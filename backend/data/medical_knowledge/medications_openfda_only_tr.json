      "note": "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Generalized Anxiety Disorder : ( 2.1 ) Recommended starting oral dosage is 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg three times daily. Dosage may be increased, at intervals of every 3 to 4 days, to a maximum recommended daily dose of 4 mg, given in divided doses. Use the lowest possible effective dose and frequently assess the need for continued treatment. Panic Disorder : Recommended starting oral dosage is 0.5 mg three times daily. The dosage may be increased at intervals of every 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg per day. ( 2.2 ) When tapering, decrease dosage by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. Some patients may require an even slower dosage reduction. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) See the Full Prescribing Information for the recommended dosage in geriatric patients, patients with hepatic impairment, and with use with ritonavir. ( 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ) 2.1 Dosage in Generalized Anxiety Disorder The recommended starting oral dosage of alprazolam tablets for the acute treatment of patients with GAD is 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg administered three times daily. Depending upon the response, the dosage may be adjusted at intervals of every 3 to 4 days. The maximum recommended dosage is 4 mg daily (in divided doses). Use the lowest possible effective dose and frequently assess the need for continued treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 2.2 Dosage in Panic Disorder The recommended starting oral dosage of alprazolam tablets for the treatment of PD is 0.5 mg three times daily. Depending on the response, the dosage may be increased at intervals of every 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg per day. Controlled trials of alprazolam tablets in the treatment of panic disorder included dosages in the range of 1 mg to 10 mg daily. The mean dosage was approximately 5 mg to 6 mg daily. Occasional patients required as much as 10 mg per day. For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised. In a controlled postmarketing dose-response study, patients treated with doses of alprazolam tablets greater than 4 mg per day for 3 months were able to taper to 50% of their total maintenance dose without apparent loss of clinical benefit. The necessary duration of treatment for PD in patients responding to alprazolam tablets are unknown. After a period of extended freedom from panic attacks, a carefully supervised tapered discontinuation may be attempted, but there is evidence that this may often be difficult to accomplish without recurrence of symptoms and/or the manifestation of withdrawal phenomena [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 2.3 Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Alprazolam Tablets To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue alprazolam tablets or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]. Reduced the dosage by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. Some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation. Some patients may prove resistant to all discontinuation regimens. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared the recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome. 2.4 Dosage Recommendations in Geriatric Patients In geriatric patients, the recommended starting oral dosage of alprazolam tablets is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. Geriatric patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dosage, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.5 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, the recommended starting oral dosage of alprazolam tablets is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dose, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.6 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Alprazolam tablets should be reduced to half of the recommended dosage when a patient is started on ritonavir and alprazolam tablets together, or when ritonavir administered to a patient treated with alprazolam tablets. Increase the alprazolam tablets dosage to the target dose after 10 to 14 days of dosing ritonavir and alprazolam tablets together. It is not necessary to reduce alprazolam tablets dose in patients who have been taking ritonavir for more than 10 to 14 days. Alprazolam tablets are contraindicated with concomitant use of all strong CYP3A inhibitors, except ritonavir [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] .",

    "overdose_warning": "10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage. In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway management. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information. Consider contacting the Poison Help Line (1-800-222-1222), or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.",

In humans, experience with intentional overdosage of amlodipine is limited. Single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg amlodipine/kg and 100 mg amlodipine/kg in mice and rats, respectively, caused deaths. Single oral amlodipine maleate doses equivalent to 4 or more mg amlodipine/kg or higher in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension. If massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, provide cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious (including fatal) hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium if a reaction occurs. ( 5.1 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCAR): Monitor closely. Discontinue if rash progresses. ( 5.2 ) Hepatic dysfunction and cholestatic jaundice: Discontinue if signs/symptoms of hepatitis occur. Monitor liver function tests in patients with hepatic impairment. ( 5.3 ) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD): Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.4 ) Patients with mononucleosis who receive Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium develop skin rash. Avoid Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium use in these patients. ( 5.5 ) Overgrowth: The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials, including Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium may cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). If patients develop a skin rash, they should be monitored closely, and Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium discontinued if lesions progress. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice has been associated with the use of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment. 5.4 Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.5 Skin Rash in Patients with Mononucleosis A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. 5.6 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. If superinfection occurs, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.7 Phenylketonurics Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Chewable tablets and Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension contain aspartame which contains phenylalanine. Each 200 mg chewable tablet of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium contains 2.1 mg phenylalanine; each 400 mg chewable tablet contains 4.2 mg phenylalanine; each 5 mL of either the 200 mg/5 mL or 400 mg/5 mL oral suspension contains 7 mg phenylalanine. The other formulations of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium do not contain phenylalanine. 5.8 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug‑resistant bacteria."

( 7.3 ) Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium may reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin but does not delay renal excretion of clavulanic acid. Concurrent use with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium may result in increased and prolonged blood concentrations of amoxicillin. Co-administration of probenecid is not recommended. 7.2 Oral Anticoagulants Abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time (increased international normalized ratio [INR]) has been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation. 7.3 Allopurinol The concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium may affect intestinal flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives. 7.5 Effects on Laboratory Tests High urine concentrations of amoxicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST ® , Benedict's Solution, or Fehling's Solution. Since this effect may also occur with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions be used. Following administration of amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Anaphylactic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most frequently reported adverse effects were diarrhea/loose stools (9%), nausea (3%), skin rashes and urticaria (3%), vomiting (1%) and vaginitis (1%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact USAntibiotics, LLC at 1-844-454-5532 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea/loose stools (9%), nausea (3%), skin rashes and urticaria (3%), vomiting (1%) and vaginitis (1%). Less than 3% of patients discontinued therapy because of drug‑related adverse reactions. The overall incidence of adverse reactions, and in particular diarrhea, increased with the higher recommended dose. Other less frequently reported adverse reactions (less than 1%) include: Abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and headache. In pediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years), 1 US/Canadian clinical trial was conducted which compared 45/6.4 mg/kg/day (divided every 12 hours) of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for 10 days versus 40/10 mg/kg/day (divided every 8 hours) of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for 10 days in the treatment of acute otitis media. A total of 575 patients were enrolled, and only the suspension formulations were used in this trial. Overall, the adverse reactions seen were comparable to that noted above; however, there were differences in the rates of diarrhea, skin rashes/urticaria, and diaper area rashes. [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during postmarketing use of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium. Gastrointestinal: Indigestion, gastritis, stomatitis, glossitis, black “hairy” tongue, mucocutaneous candidiasis, enterocolitis, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Immune: Hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (including shock), angioedema, serum sickness-like reactions (urticaria or skin rash accompanied by arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia, and frequently fever), hypersensitivity vasculitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Skin and Appendages: Rashes, pruritus, urticaria, erythema multiforme, SJS, TEN, DRESS, AGEP, exfoliative dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Liver: Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice, increases in serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT), serum bilirubin, and/or alkaline phosphatase, has been reported with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium. It has been reported more commonly in the elderly, in males, or in patients on prolonged treatment. The histologic findings on liver biopsy have consisted of predominantly cholestatic, hepatocellular, or mixed cholestatic hepatocellular changes. The onset of signs/symptoms of hepatic dysfunction may occur during or several weeks after therapy has been discontinued. The hepatic dysfunction, which may be severe, is usually reversible. Deaths have been reported [see Contraindications ( 4.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Renal: Interstitial nephritis, hematuria, and crystalluria have been reported [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Hemic and Lymphatic Systems: Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Thrombocytosis was noted in less than 1% of the patients treated with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium. There have been reports of increased prothrombin time in patients receiving Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium and anticoagulant therapy concomitantly [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, behavioral changes, aseptic meningitis, confusion, convulsions, dizziness, insomnia, and reversible hyperactivity have been reported. Miscellaneous: Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining) has been reported. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases."

Crystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium crystalluria. Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration. High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.

( 1.5 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AMOXICILLIN and other antibacterial drugs, AMOXICILLIN should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. ( 1.6 ) 1.1 Infections of the Ear, Nose, and Throat AMOXICILLIN is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY β-lactamase–negative) isolates of Streptococcus species. (α and β hemolytic isolates only), Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus spp., or Haemophilus influenzae . 1.2 Infections of the Genitourinary Tract AMOXICILLIN is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY β-lactamase–negative) isolates of Escherichia coli , Proteus mirabilis , or Enterococcus faecalis . 1.3 Infections of the Skin and Skin Structure AMOXICILLIN is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY β-lactamase–negative) isolates of Streptococcus spp. (α and β hemolytic isolates only), Staphylococcus spp., or E. coli. 1.4 Infections of the Lower Respiratory Tract AMOXICILLIN is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY β-lactamase–negative) isolates of Streptococcus spp. (α and β hemolytic isolates only), S. pneumoniae , S taphylococcus spp ., or H. influenzae . 1.5 Helicobacter pylori Infection Triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori with clarithromycin and lansoprazole: AMOXICILLIN, in combination with clarithromycin plus lansoprazole as triple therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1 year history of a duodenal ulcer) to eradicate H. pylori . Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Dual therapy for H. pylori with lansoprazole : AMOXICILLIN, in combination with lansoprazole delayed release capsules as dual therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1 year history of a duodenal ulcer) who are either allergic or intolerant to clarithromycin or in whom resistance to clarithromycin is known or suspected . (See the clarithromycin package insert, MICROBIOLOGY.) Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. 1.6 Usage To reduce the development of drug resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AMOXICILLIN and other antibacterial drugs, AMOXICILLIN should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylactic reactions: Serious and occasionally fatal anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with supportive measures. ( 5.1 ) Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis): Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy including amoxicillin. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before initiating therapy with AMOXICILLIN, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, AMOXICILLIN should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.2 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including AMOXICILLIN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing AMOXICILLIN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.4 Use in Patients With Mononucleosis A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus amoxicillin should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. 5.5 Phenylketonurics Amoxicillin chewable tablets contain aspartame which contains phenylalanine. Each 200 mg chewable tablet contains 1.82 mg phenylalanine; each 400 mg chewable tablet contains 3.64 mg phenylalanine. The oral suspensions of Amoxicillin do not contain phenylalanine and can be used by phenylketonurics."

Before therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, ampicillin and sulbactam for injection should be discontinued and the appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice has been associated with the use of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection may cause severe skin reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), dermatitis exfoliative, erythema multiforme, and Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and ampicillin and sulbactam for injection discontinued if lesions progress (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections).

Additionally, atypical lymphocytosis has been observed in one pediatric patient receiving ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes without regard to drug relationship that were reported during clinical trials were: Hepatic : Increased AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, and LDH. Hematologic : Decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and increased lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and platelets. Blood Chemistry : Decreased serum albumin and total proteins. Renal : Increased BUN and creatinine. Urinalysis : Presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during post-marketing use of ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium or other products containing ampicillin. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency, or potential causal connection to ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Some individuals have developed positive direct Coombs Tests during treatment with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, as with other beta-lactam antibacterials. Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal pain, cholestatic hepatitis, cholestasis, hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, abnormal hepatic function, melena, gastritis, stomatitis, dyspepsia, black “hairy” tongue, and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections). General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Injection site reaction Immune System Disorders Serious and fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions (see WARNINGS section), Acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction may occur as part of an allergic reaction.

      "BOXED WARNING WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF APIXABAN INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF APIXABAN INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including apixaban, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with apixaban is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Studies ( 14.1)] . (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with apixaban who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include: • use of indwelling epidural catheters • concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants • a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures • a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery • optimal timing between the administration of apixaban and neuraxial procedures is not known [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )].

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Apixaban is a substrate of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp increase exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of bleeding. Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp decrease exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events. Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase blood levels of apixaban. Reduce apixaban dose or avoid coadministration. ( 2.5 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) Simultaneous use of combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers reduces blood levels of apixaban: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Combined P-gp Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors For patients receiving apixaban 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, the dose of apixaban should be decreased by 50% when coadministered with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. For patients receiving apixaban at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Clarithromycin Although clarithromycin is a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, pharmacokinetic data suggest that no dose adjustment is necessary with concomitant administration with apixaban [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. 7.2 Combined P-gp Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of apixaban tablets with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort) because such drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents Coadministration of antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding. APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk, post-acute coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with apixaban compared to placebo. The rate of ISTH major bleeding was 2.8% per year with apixaban versus 0.6% per year with placebo in patients receiving single antiplatelet therapy and was 5.9% per year with apixaban versus 2.5% per year with placebo in those receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. In ARISTOTLE, concomitant use of aspirin increased the bleeding risk on apixaban from 1.8% per year to 3.4% per year and concomitant use of aspirin and warfarin increased the bleeding risk from 2.7% per year to 4.6% per year. In this clinical trial, there was limited (2.3%) use of dual antiplatelet therapy with apixaban."

In controlled clinical trials, orally administered apixaban in healthy subjects at doses up to 50 mg daily for 3 to 7 days (25 mg twice daily for 7 days or 50 mg once daily for 3 days) had no clinically relevant adverse effects. In healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20-mg dose of apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of apixaban overdose or accidental ingestion. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available.",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis: Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs, and higher atorvastatin calcium dosage. Discontinue atorvastatin calcium if markedly elevated CK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Temporarily discontinue atorvastatin calcium in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing atorvastatin calcium dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever ( 2.5 , 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.5 , 8.6 ). Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM): Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported with statin use. Discontinue atorvastatin calcium if IMNM is suspected ( 5.2 ). Hepatic Dysfunction: Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzymes before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue atorvastatin calcium ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Atorvastatin calcium may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including atorvastatin. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher atorvastatin dosage [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6 ) ]. Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Atorvastatin exposure may be increased by drug interactions due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) and/or transporters (e.g., breast cancer resistant protein [BCRP], organic anion-transporting polypeptide [OATP1B1/OATP1B3] and P-glycoprotein [P-gp]), resulting in an increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, tipranavir plus ritonavir, or glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir with atorvastatin is not recommended. Atorvastatin dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain anti-viral, azole antifungals, or macrolide antibiotic medications [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with lipid modifying doses (>1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir. Consider if the benefit of use of these products outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Concomitant intake of large quantities, more than 1.2 liters daily, of grapefruit juice is not recommended in patients taking atorvastatin [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Discontinue atorvastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if atorvastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue atorvastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy). Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the atorvastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persists despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue atorvastatin if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of atorvastatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 0.7% of patients receiving atorvastatin in clinical trials. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Consider liver enzyme testing before atorvastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4) ]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue atorvastatin. 5.4 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including atorvastatin. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices. 5.5 Increased Risk of Hemorrhagic Stroke in Patients on Atorvastatin Calcium 80 mg with Recent Hemorrhagic Stroke In a post-hoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial where 2365 adult patients, without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, were treated with atorvastatin 80 mg, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the atorvastatin 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3% atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4% placebo; HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.59; p=0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6%) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7%). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Consider the risk/benefit of use of atorvastatin 80 mg in patients with recent hemorrhagic stroke."

    "content": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below. Recommended dosages and durations of therapy in adult and pediatric patient populations vary in these indications. [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for mild to moderate infections caused by designated, susceptible bacteria: • Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in adults ( 1.1 ) • Acute bacterial sinusitis in adults ( 1.1 ) • Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections in adults ( 1.1 ) • Urethritis and cervicitis in adults ( 1.1 ) • Genital ulcer disease in men ( 1.1 ) • Acute otitis media in pediatric patients (6 months of age and older) ( 1.2 ) • Community-acquired pneumonia in adults and pediatric patients (6 months of age and older) ( 1.1 , 1.2 ) • Pharyngitis/tonsillitis in adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) ( 1.1 , 1.2 ) Limitation of Use: Azithromycin should not be used in patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors. ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin tablets should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. ( 1.4 ) 1.1 Adult Patients • Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae . • Acute bacterial sinusitis due to Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis. or Streptococcus pneumoniae . • Community-acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy. • Pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy. • Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections due to Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pyogenes , or Streptococcus agalactiae . • Urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae . • Genital ulcer disease in men due to Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid). Due to the small number of women included in clinical trials, the efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of chancroid in women has not been established. 1.2 Pediatric Patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] • Acute otitis media (>6 months of age) caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis , or Streptococcus pneumoniae. • Community-acquired pneumonia (>6 months of age) due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae , or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy. • Pharyngitis/tonsillitis (>2 years of age) caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy. 1.3 Limitations of Use Azithromycin should not be used in patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors such as any of the following: • patients with cystic fibrosis, • patients with nosocomial infections, • patients with known or suspected bacteremia, • patients requiring hospitalization, • elderly or debilitated patients, or • patients with significant underlying health problems that may compromise their ability to respond to their illness (including immunodeficiency or functional asplenia). 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin tablets should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Serious (including fatal) allergic and skin reactions: Discontinue azithromycin if reaction occurs. ( 5.1 ) • Hepatotoxicity: Severe, and sometimes fatal, hepatotoxicity has been reported. Discontinue azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur. ( 5.2 ) • Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS): Following the use of azithromycin in neonates (treatment up to 42 days of life), IHPS has been reported. Direct parents and caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs. ( 5.3 ) • Prolongation of QT interval and cases of torsades de pointes have been reported. This risk which can be fatal should be considered in patients with certain cardiovascular disorders including known QT prolongation or history torsades de pointes, those with proarrhythmic conditions, and with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. ( 5.4 ) • Cardiovascular Death: Some observational studies have shown an approximately two-fold increased short-term potential risk of acute cardiovascular death in adults exposed to azithromycin relative to other antibacterial drugs, including amoxicillin. Consider balancing this potential risk with treatment benefits when prescribing azithromycin. ( 5.5 ) • Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea: Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.6 ) • Azithromycin may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and dermatologic reactions including Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients on azithromycin therapy. [see Contraindications (4.1) ] Fatalities have been reported. Cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have also been reported. Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms, when symptomatic therapy was discontinued, the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure. These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment. The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half-life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is presently unknown. If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Physicians should be aware that allergic symptoms may reappear when symptomatic therapy has been discontinued. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported, some of which have resulted in death. Discontinue azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur. 5.3 Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS) Following the use of azithromycin in neonates (treatment up to 42 days of life), IHPS has been reported. Direct parents and caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs. 5.4 QT Prolongation Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval, imparting a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia and torsades de pointes, have been seen with treatment with macrolides, including azithromycin. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving azithromycin. Providers should consider the risk of QT prolongation which can be fatal when weighing the risks and benefits of azithromycin for at-risk groups including: • patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, a history of torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure • patients on drugs known to prolong the QT interval • patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, and in patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. 5.5 Cardiovascular Death Some observational studies have shown an approximately two-fold increased short-term potential risk of acute cardiovascular death in adults exposed to azithromycin relative to other antibacterial drugs, including amoxicillin. The five-day cardiovascular mortality observed in these studies ranged from 20 to 400 per million azithromycin treatment courses. This potential risk was noted to be greater during the first five days of azithromycin use and does not appear to be limited to those patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases. The data in these observational studies are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between acute cardiovascular death and azithromycin use. Consider balancing this potential risk with treatment benefits when prescribing azithromycin. 5.6 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including azithromycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of myasthenic syndrome have been reported in patients receiving azithromycin therapy. 5.8 Use in Sexually Transmitted Infections Azithromycin, at the recommended dose, should not be relied upon to treat syphilis. Antibacterial agents used to treat non-gonococcal urethritis may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis. All patients with sexually transmitted urethritis or cervicitis should have a serologic test for syphilis and appropriate testing for gonorrhea performed at the time of diagnosis. Appropriate antibacterial therapy and follow-up tests for these diseases should be initiated if infection is confirmed. 5.9 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing azithromycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Nelfinavir: Close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted. ( 7.1 ) • Warfarin: Use with azithromycin may increase coagulation times; monitor prothrombin time. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Nelfinavir Co-administration of nelfinavir at steady-state with a single oral dose of azithromycin resulted in increased azithromycin serum concentrations. Although a dose adjustment of azithromycin is not recommended when administered in combination with nelfinavir, close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted. [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] 7.2 Warfarin Spontaneous postmarketing reports suggest that concomitant administration of azithromycin may potentiate the effects of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, although the prothrombin time was not affected in the dedicated drug interaction study with azithromycin and warfarin. Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving azithromycin and oral anticoagulants concomitantly. 7.3 Potential Drug-Drug Interaction with Macrolides Interactions with digoxin, colchicine or phenytoin have not been reported in clinical trials with azithromycin. No specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interaction. However, drug interactions have been observed with other macrolide products. Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when digoxin, colchicine or phenytoin are used with azithromycin careful monitoring of patients is advised."

      "WARNINGS Click here to enter Warnings Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and beta-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In general, beta-blocking agents should be avoided in patients with overt congestive failure. However, in some patients with compensated cardiac failure it may be necessary to utilize them. In such a situation, they must be used cautiously. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blockers can, in some patients, precipitate cardiac failure. At the first signs or symptoms of heart failure, discontinuation of bisoprolol fumarate tablets should be considered. In some cases, beta-blocker therapy can be continued while heart failure is treated with other drugs. Abrupt Cessation of Therapy Exacerbation of angina pectoris, and, in some instances, myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia, have been observed in patients with coronary artery disease following abrupt cessation of therapy with beta-blockers. Such patients should, therefore, be cautioned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician’s advice. Even in patients without overt coronary artery disease, it may be advisable to taper therapy with bisoprolol fumarate tablets over approximately one week with the patient under careful observation. If withdrawal symptoms occur, bisoprolol fumarate tablets therapy should be reinstituted, at least temporarily. Peripheral Vascular Disease Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in such individuals. Bronchospastic Disease PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASE SHOULD, IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Because of its relative beta 1 -selectivity, however, bisoprolol fumarate tablets may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or who cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment. Since beta 1 -selectivity is not absolute, the lowest possible dose of bisoprolol fumarate tablets should be used, with therapy starting at 2.5 mg. A beta 2 agonist (bronchodilator) should be made available. Major Surgery Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. Diabetes and Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective beta-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. Because of its beta 1 -selectivity, this is less likely with bisoprolol fumarate tablets. However, patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be cautioned about these possibilities and bisoprolol fumarate should be used with caution. Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate thyroid storm."

      "note": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dose of bisoprolol fumarate tablets must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily. In some patients, 2.5 mg may be an appropriate starting dose (see Bronchospastic Disease in WARNINGS ). If the antihypertensive effect of 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min), the initial daily dose should be 2.5 mg and caution should be used in dose-titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialyzable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis. Geriatric Patients It is not necessary to adjust the dose in the elderly, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction (see above and Geriatric Use in PRECAUTIONS ).

    "overdose_warning": "OVERDOSAGE The most common signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia, hypotension, congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia. To date, a few cases of overdose (maximum: 2000 mg) with bisoprolol fumarate have been reported. Bradycardia and/or hypotension were noted. Sympathomimetic agents were given in some cases, and all patients recovered. In general, if overdose occurs, bisoprolol fumarate tablets therapy should be stopped and supportive and symptomatic treatment should be provided. Limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialyzable. Based on the expected pharmacologic actions and recommendations for other beta-blockers, the following general measures should be considered when clinically warranted: Bradycardia Administer IV atropine. If the response is inadequate, isoproterenol or another agent with positive chronotropic properties may be given cautiously. Under some circumstances, transvenous pacemaker insertion may be necessary. Hypotension IV fluids and vasopressors should be administered. Intravenous glucagon may be useful. Heart Block (second or third degree) Patients should be carefully monitored and treated with isoproterenol infusion or transvenous cardiac pacemaker insertion, as appropriate. Congestive Heart Failure Initiate conventional therapy (ie, digitalis, diuretics, inotropic agents, vasodilating agents). Bronchospasm Administer bronchodilator therapy such as isoproterenol and/or aminophylline. Hypoglycemia Administer IV glucose.",

Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should be used for patients not adequately controlled on a long term asthma control medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid or whose disease warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and long acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABA). Limitations of Use : Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol Multi-Dose Dry Powder Inhaler (MDPI) is a combination of fluticasone propionate, a corticosteroid, and salmeterol, a long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABA), indicated for treatment of asthma in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol inhalation powder should be used for patients not adequately controlled on a long term asthma control medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid or whose disease warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and long acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABA). ( 1 ) Limitations of Use : Not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. ( 1 )",
    "warnings": [
      "5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life‑threatening episodes of asthma. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating asthma. The initiation of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI in this setting is not appropriate. Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported when salmeterol, a component of this product, has been initiated in patients with significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. In most cases, these have occurred in patients with severe asthma (e.g., patients with a history of corticosteroid dependence, low pulmonary function, intubation, mechanical ventilation, frequent hospitalizations, previous life‑threatening acute asthma exacerbations) and in some patients with acutely deteriorating asthma (e.g., patients with significantly increasing symptoms; increasing need for inhaled, short‑acting beta 2 ‑agonists; decreasing response to usual medications; increasing need for systemic corticosteroids; recent emergency room visits; deteriorating lung function). However, these events have occurred in a few patients with less severe asthma as well. It was not possible from these reports to determine whether salmeterol contributed to these events. Increasing use of inhaled, short‑acting beta 2 ‑agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for replacing the current strength of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, or initiating systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation twice daily of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. An inhaled, short‑acting beta 2 ‑agonist, not Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath. When prescribing Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short‑acting beta 2 -agonist (e.g., albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms, despite regular twice‑daily use of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. When beginning treatment with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short‑acting beta 2 ‑agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs.",
      "5.3 Avoid Excessive Use of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol and Avoid Use with Other Long-Acting Beta 2 -Agonists Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.",
      "5.4 Oropharyngeal Candidiasis In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred in subjects treated with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI continues, but at times therapy with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.",
      "5.5 Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible adolescents or adults using corticosteroids. In such patients who have not had these diseases or who have not been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.",
      "5.6 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy HPA Suppression/Adrenal Insufficiency Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies. During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physician for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a medical identification warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack. Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV 1 ] or morning peak expiratory flow [AM PEF]), beta‑agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension. Unmasking of Allergic Conditions Previously Suppressed by Systemic Corticosteroids Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). Corticosteroid Withdrawal Symptoms During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.",
      "5.7 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression Fluticasone propionate, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since fluticasone propionate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. A relationship between plasma levels of fluticasone propionate and inhibitory effects on stimulated cortisol production has been shown after 4 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response. It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids, and for management of asthma symptoms.",
      "5.8 Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].",
      "5.9 Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms As with other inhaled medicines, Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life‑threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol medicines, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol medicines should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted. Upper airway symptoms of laryngeal spasm, irritation, or swelling, such as stridor and choking, have been reported in patients receiving inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol medicines.",
      "5.10 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powder products containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI [see Contraindications ( 4 )].",
      "5.11 Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System Effects Excessive beta‑adrenergic stimulation has been associated with seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia [see Overdosage ]. Therefore, Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, like all products containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Salmeterol, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of salmeterol at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta‑agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Large doses of inhaled or oral salmeterol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.",
      "5.12 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long‑term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long‑term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care.",
      "5.13 Effect on Growth Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, titrate each patient’s dosage to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] .",
      "5.14 Glaucoma and Cataracts Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Effects of treatment with other fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, salmeterol 50 mcg, or placebo on development of cataracts or glaucoma was evaluated in a subset of 658 subjects with COPD in the 3-year survival trial. Ophthalmic examinations were conducted at baseline and at 48, 108, and 158 weeks. Conclusions about cataracts cannot be drawn from this trial because the high incidence of cataracts at baseline (61% to 71%) resulted in an inadequate number of subjects treated with other fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg who were eligible and available for evaluation of cataracts at the end of the trial (n = 53). The incidence of newly diagnosed glaucoma was 2% with other fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, 5% with fluticasone propionate, 0% with salmeterol, and 2% with placebo.",
      "5.15 Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome In rare cases, patients on inhaled fluticasone propionate, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg‑Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of fluticasone propionate. Cases of serious eosinophilic conditions have also been reported with other inhaled corticosteroids in this clinical setting. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between fluticasone propionate and these underlying conditions has not been established.",
      "5.16 Coexisting Conditions Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta 2 ‑adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.",
      "5.17 Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia Beta‑adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Clinically significant changes in blood glucose and/or serum potassium were seen infrequently during clinical trials with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI at recommended doses."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7.1 Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol, the individual components of this product, are substrates of CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur. Ritonavir : Fluticasone Propionate: A drug interaction trial with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression. Ketoconazole : Fluticasone Propionate: Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in a 1.9‑fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45% decrease in plasma cortisol area under the curve (AUC) but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. Salmeterol: In a drug interaction trial in 20 healthy subjects, coadministration of inhaled salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and oral ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in greater systemic exposure to salmeterol (AUC increased 16‑fold and C max increased 1.4‑fold). Three (3) subjects were withdrawn due to beta 2 ‑agonist side effects (2 with prolonged QTc and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .",
      "7.2 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of salmeterol, a component of this product, on the vascular system may be potentiated by these agents.",
      "7.4 Non-Potassium-Sparing Diuretics The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non–potassium‑sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta‑agonists, such as salmeterol, a component of this product, especially when the recommended dose of the beta‑agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI with non-potassium‑sparing diuretics."

      "note": "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For oral inhalation only. ( 2.1 ) Starting dosage is based on prior asthma therapy and disease severity. ( 2.2 ) 1 inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol 55 mcg/14 mcg, 113 mcg/14 mcg, or 232 mcg/14 mcg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Do not use with a spacer or volume holding chamber. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Administration Instructions Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is for oral inhalation and does not require priming. Do not use Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI with a spacer or volume holding chamber. Do not use more than two times every 24 hours. More frequent administration or a greater number of daily inhalations (more than one inhalation twice daily) is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse reactions with higher salmeterol dosages. Avoid the concomitant use of other long acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABAs) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.11 )]. If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist should be taken for immediate relief. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Administer 1 inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI twice daily by oral inhalation (approximately 12 hours apart at the same time every day). Rinse the mouth with water without swallowing after each inhalation. Dosage Selection The recommended starting dosage for Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is based on asthma severity and current inhaled corticosteroid use and strength. Patients not taking inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (with less severe asthma): 1 inhalation of 55 mcg/14 mcg Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI dose strength (55 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 14 mcg of salmeterol), twice daily by oral inhalation. Patients with greater asthma severity, use the higher dose strengths: 1 inhalation of 113 mcg/14 mcg Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI (113 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 14 mcg of salmeterol) twice daily; or 1 inhalation of 232 mcg/14 mcg Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI (232 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 14 mcg of salmeterol) twice daily Patients switching to Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI from another inhaled corticosteroid or combination product: 1 inhalation of low (55 mcg/14 mcg), medium (113 mcg/14 mcg) or high (232 mcg/14 mcg) Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI twice daily by oral inhalation based on the strength of the previous inhaled corticosteroid product, or the strength of the inhaled corticosteroid from a combination product, and disease severity. The maximum recommended dosage of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is 232 mcg/14 mcg twice daily. General Dosing Information Improvement in asthma control following Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI administration can occur within 15 minutes of beginning treatment; although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 week or longer after starting treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI after 2 weeks of therapy, consider increasing the strength (replace with higher strength) to possibly provide additional improvement in asthma control. If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide adequate improvement in asthma control, re-evaluate the therapeutic regimen, including patient compliance and inhaler technique, and consider additional therapeutic options (e.g., increasing the dose of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI with a higher strength, adding additional controller therapies). After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the risk of adverse reactions. 2.3 Storing and Cleaning the Inhaler Keep the inhaler in a cool dry place. Routine maintenance is not required. If the mouthpiece needs cleaning, gently wipe the mouthpiece with a dry cloth or tissue as needed. Never wash or put any part of the inhaler in water. 2.4 Dose Counter The Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI has a dose counter: The number 60 is displayed (prior to use). The dose counter will count down each time the mouthpiece is opened and closed [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )].",

    "overdose_warning": "10 OVERDOSAGE This product contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta‑receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases of overdosage. Fluticasone propionate Chronic overdosage of fluticasone propionate may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Salmeterol The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of salmeterol are those of excessive beta‑adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms of beta‑adrenergic stimulation (e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis). Overdosage with salmeterol can lead to clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which can produce ventricular arrhythmias. As with all inhaled sympathomimetic medicines, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with an overdose of salmeterol.",

(1.6) 1.1 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections Cefixime for oral suspension is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis . 1.2 Otitis Media Cefixime for oral suspension is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with otitis media caused by susceptible isolates of Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis , and Streptococcus pyogenes. (Efficacy for Streptococcus pyogenes in this organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections.) Note: For patients with otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , overall response was approximately 10% lower for cefixime than for the comparator [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 1.3 Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis Cefixime for oral suspension is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with pharyngitis and tonsillitis caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes. (Note: Penicillin is the usual drug of choice in the treatment of Streptococcus pyogenes infections. Cefixime for oral suspension is generally effective in the eradication of Streptococcus pyogenes from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of cefixime for oral suspension in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever is not available.) 1.4 Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis Cefixime for oral suspension is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. 1.5 Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral) Cefixime for oral suspension is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with uncomplicated gonorrhea (cervical/urethral) caused by susceptible isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (penicillinase-and non-penicillinase-producing isolates). 1.6 Usage To reduce the development of drug resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefixime for oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs, cefixime for oral suspension should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including shock and fatalities have been reported with cefixime. Discontinue use if a reaction occurs. (5.1) Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.2) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (including shock and fatalities) have been reported with the use of cefixime. Before therapy with cefixime is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs. If this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients, caution should be exercised because cross hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to cefixime occurs, discontinue the drug. 5.2 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefixime, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Dose Adjustment in Renal Impairment The dose of cefixime should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment as well as those undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD). Patients on dialysis should be monitored carefully [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . 5.4 Coagulation Effects Cephalosporins, including cefixime, may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated. 5.5 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing cefixime in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria."

Limitations of Use The effectiveness of Cefuroxime axetil for sinus infections caused by β-lactamase–producing Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis in patients with acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis was not established due to insufficient numbers of these isolates in the clinical trials [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . 1.4 Acute Bacterial Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with mild-to-moderate acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae (β-lactamase–negative strains), or Haemophilus parainfluenzae (β-lactamase–negative strains). 1.5 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin-Structure Infections Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus (including β - lactamase–producing strains) or Streptococcus pyogenes. 1.6 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by susceptible strains of Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae . 1.7 Uncomplicated Gonorrhea Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with uncomplicated gonorrhea, urethral and endocervical, caused by penicillinase-producing and non-penicillinase–producing susceptible strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and uncomplicated gonorrhea, rectal, in females, caused by non-penicillinase–producing susceptible strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae . 1.8 Early Lyme Disease (erythema migrans) Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with early Lyme disease (erythema migrans) caused by susceptible strains of Borrelia burgdorferi. 1.10 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefuroxime axetil and other antibacterial drugs, cefuroxime axetil should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions: In the event of a serious reaction, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD): If diarrhea occurs, evaluate patients for CDAD. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on β-lactam antibacterials, including cefuroxime axetil [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of β-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Cefuroxime axetil is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to cefuroxime axetil or other β-lactam antibacterial drugs [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Before initiating therapy with cefuroxime axetil, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. 5.2 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefuroxime axetil, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. 5.4 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing cefuroxime axetil either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.6 Interference with Glucose Tests A false-positive result for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests, and a false-negative result for blood/plasma glucose may occur with ferricyanide tests in subjects receiving cefuroxime axetil [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3) ] ."

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Cefuroxime axetil is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to cefuroxime axetil or to other β-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to cefuroxime axetil or to other β-lactams (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins)."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may lower the bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil. ( 7.1 ) Coadministration with probenecid increases systemic exposure to cefuroxime axetil and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Reduce Gastric Acidity Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil compared with administration in the fasting state. Administration of drugs that reduce gastric acidity may negate the food effect of increased absorption of cefuroxime axetil when administered in the postprandial state. Administer cefuroxime axetil at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short-acting antacids. Histamine-2 (H2) antagonists and proton pump inhibitors should be avoided. 7.2 Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil tablets increases serum concentrations of cefuroxime [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Coadministration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil is not recommended. 7.3 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests (e.g., Benedict's or Fehling's solution), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria. As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test, it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood/plasma glucose levels in patients receiving cefuroxime axetil. The presence of cefuroxime does not interfere with the assay of serum and urine creatinine by the alkaline picrate method."

( 1.9 ) 1.1 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis Clarithromycin tablets are indicated in adults for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to Haemophilus influenzae , Haemophilus parainfluenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis , or Streptococcus pneumoniae [see Indications and Usage ( 1.9 )] . 1.2 Acute Maxillary Sinusitis Clarithromycin tablets are indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis , or Streptococcus pneumoniae [see Indications and Usage ( 1.9 )] . 1.3 Community-Acquired Pneumonia Clarithromycin tablets are indicated [see Indications and Usage ( 1.9 )] for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to: Haemophilus influenzae (in adults) Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae (in adults and pediatric patients) 1.4 Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis Clarithromycin tablets are indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative in individuals who cannot use first line therapy. 1.5 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Clarithromycin tablets are indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to Staphylococcus aureus , or S treptococcus pyogenes . 1.6 Acute Otitis Media Clarithromycin tablets are indicated in pediatric patients for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis , or Streptococcus pneumoniae [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . 1.7 Treatment and Prophylaxis of Disseminated Mycobacterial Infections Clarithromycin tablets are indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to Mycobacterium avium or Myc obacterium intracellulare in patients with advanced HIV infection [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . 1.8 Helicobacter pylori Infection and Duodenal Ulcer Disease Clarithromycin tablets are given in combination with other drugs in adults as described below to eradicate H. pylori . The eradication of H. pylori has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . Clarithromycin tablets in combination with amoxicillin and PREVACID (lansoprazole) or PRILOSEC (omeprazole) delayed-release capsules, as triple therapy, are indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or five-year history of duodenal ulcer) to eradicate H. pylori . Clarithromycin tablets in combination with PRILOSEC (omeprazole) capsules are indicated for the treatment of patients with an active duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori infection. Regimens which contain clarithromycin tablets as the single antibacterial agent are more likely to be associated with the development of clarithromycin resistance among patients who fail therapy. Clarithromycin-containing regimens should not be used in patients with known or suspected clarithromycin resistant isolates because the efficacy of treatment is reduced in this setting. 1.9 Limitations of Use There is resistance to macrolides in certain bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions : Discontinue clarithromycin tablets if occurs ( 5.1 ) QT Prolongation : Avoid clarithromycin tablets in patients with known QT prolongation or receiving drugs known to prolong the QT interval, ventricular arrhythmia ( torsades de pointes ), hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia, significant bradycardia, or taking Class IA or III antiarrhythmics ( 5.2 ) Hepatotoxicity : Discontinue if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur ( 5.3 ) Serious adverse reactions can occur due to drug interactions of clarithromycin tablets with colchicine, some lipid-lowering agents, some calcium channel blockers, and other drugs ( 5.4 ) Risk of all-cause mortality one year or more after the end of treatment in patients with coronary artery disease. Balance this potential risk with the treatment benefits when prescribing clarithromycin tablets in these patients ( 5.5 ) Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) : Evaluate if diarrhea occurs ( 5.6 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Based on animal findings, clarithromycin tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women except in clinical circumstances where no alternative therapy is appropriate ( 5.7 ) Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported in patients receiving clarithromycin tablets therapy ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions In the event of severe acute hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, discontinue clarithromycin tablets therapy immediately and institute appropriate treatment. 5.2 QT Prolongation Clarithromycin tablets have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval and infrequent cases of arrhythmia. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving clarithromycin tablets. Fatalities have been reported. Avoid clarithromycin tablets in the following patients: patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, including torsades de pointes patients receiving drugs known to prolong the QT interval [see also Contraindications ( 4.2 )] • patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia,clinically significant bradycardia and in patients receiving Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide,disopyramide) or Class III (e.g., dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic dysfunction, including increased liver enzymes, and hepatocellular and/or cholestatic hepatitis, with or without jaundice, has been reported with clarithromycin. This hepatic dysfunction may be severe and is usually reversible. In some instances, hepatic failure with fatal outcome has been reported and generally has been associated with serious underlying diseases and/or concomitant medications. Symptoms of hepatitis can include anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, or tender abdomen. Discontinue clarithromycin tablets immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur. 5.4 Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Concomitant Use with Other Drugs Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4: Serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin tablets concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates. These include colchicine toxicity with colchicine; markedly increased transaminases with lomitapide; rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin; hypoglycemia and cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., torsades de pointes) with disopyramide; and hypotension and acute kidney injury with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine). Most reports of acute kidney injury with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 involved elderly patients 65 years of age or older. Use clarithromycin tablets with caution when administered concurrently with medications that induce the cytochrome CYP3A4 enzyme. The use of clarithromycin with lomitapide, simvastatin, lovastatin, ergotamine, or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.5 , 4.6 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Colchicine: Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with clarithromycin and colchicine. Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and this interaction may occur while using both drugs at their recommended doses. If co-administration of clarithromycin tablets and colchicine is necessary in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, reduce the dose of colchicine. Monitor patients for clinical symptoms of colchicine toxicity. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin tablets and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment [see Contraindications ( 4.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Lomitapide: Concomitant use of clarithromycin with lomitapide is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.5 )]. Lomitapide is metabolized by CYP3A4, and concomitant treatment with clarithromycin increases the plasma concentration of lomitapide, which increases the risk of elevation in transaminases [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. If treatment with clarithromycin cannot be avoided, therapy with lomitapide must be suspended during the course of treatment. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins): Concomitant use of clarithromycin tablets with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4.5 )] as these statins are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4, and concomitant treatment with clarithromycin increases their plasma concentration, which increases the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with these statins. If treatment with clarithromycin tablets cannot be avoided, therapy with lovastatin or simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment. Exercise caution when prescribing clarithromycin tablets with atorvastatin or pravastatin. In situations where the concomitant use of clarithromycin tablets with atorvastatin or pravastatin cannot be avoided, atorvastatin dose should not exceed 20 mg daily and pravastatin dose should not exceed 40 mg daily. Use of a statin that is not dependent on CYP3A metabolism (e.g. fluvastatin) can be considered. It is recommended to prescribe the lowest registered dose if concomitant use cannot be avoided. Oral Hypoglycemic Agents/Insulin: The concomitant use of clarithromycin tablets and oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin can result in significant hypoglycemia. With certain hypoglycemic drugs such as nateglinide, pioglitazone, repaglinide and rosiglitazone, inhibition of CYP3A enzyme by clarithromycin may be involved and could cause hypoglycemia when used concomitantly. Careful monitoring of glucose is recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Quetiapine: Use quetiapine and clarithromycin concomitantly with caution. Co-administration could result in increased quetiapine exposure and quetiapine related toxicities such as somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, altered state of consciousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and QT prolongation. Refer to quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on dose reduction if co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Oral Anticoagulants: There is a risk of serious hemorrhage and significant elevations in INR and prothrombin time when clarithromycin is co-administered with warfarin. Monitor INR and prothrombin times frequently while patients are receiving clarithromycin tablets and oral anticoagulants concurrently [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Benzodiazepines: Increased sedation and prolongation of sedation have been reported with concomitant administration of clarithromycin and triazolobenzodiazepines, such as triazolam and midazolam [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.5 All-Cause Mortality in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease 1 to 10 Years After Clarithromycin Exposure In one clinical trial evaluating treatment with clarithromycin on outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease, an increase in risk of all-cause mortality one year or more after the end of treatment was observed in patients randomized to receive clarithromycin. 1 Clarithromycin for treatment of coronary artery disease is not an approved indication. The cause of the increased risk has not been established. Other epidemiologic studies evaluating this risk have shown variable results [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Consider balancing this potential risk with the treatment benefits when prescribing Clarithromycin in patients who have suspected or confirmed coronary artery disease. 5.6 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clarithromycin tablets, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies, Clarithromycin is not recommended for use in pregnant women except in clinical circumstances where no alternative therapy is appropriate. If clarithromycin tablets are used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs while the patient is taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Clarithromycin demonstrated adverse effects on pregnancy outcome and/or embryo fetal development, including fetal malformations, in pregnant animals administered oral clarithromycin [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.8 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving clarithromycin tablets therapy. 5.9 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing clarithromycin tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria."

      "WARNING: DIMINISHED ANTIPLATELET EFFECT IN PATIENTS WITH TWO LOSS-OF-FUNCTION ALLELES OF THE CYP2C19 GENE The effectiveness of clopidogrel results from its antiplatelet activity, which is dependent on its conversion to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally CYP2C19 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Clopidogrel at recommended doses forms less of the active metabolite and so has a reduced effect on platelet activity in patients who are homozygous for nonfunctional alleles of the CYP2C19 gene, (termed “CYP2C19 poor metabolizers”). Tests are available to identify patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Consider use of another platelet P2Y 12 inhibitor in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. WARNING: DIMINISHED ANTIPLATELET EFFECT IN PATIENTS WITH TWO LOSS-OF-FUNCTION ALLELES OF THE CYP2C19 GENE See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Effectiveness of clopidogrel depends on conversion to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally CYP2C19. ( 5.1 , 12.3 ) Tests are available to identify patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. (12.5) Consider use of another platelet P2Y 12 inhibitor in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. ( 5.1)",
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS CYP2C19 inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole. (5.1) Bleeding: Clopidogrel increases risk of bleeding. (5.2) Discontinuation: Premature discontinuation increases risk of cardiovascular events. Discontinue 5 days prior to elective surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. ( 5.3 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Cross-reactivity among thienopyridines has been reported. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity in Patients with Impaired CYP2C19 Function Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see Boxed Warning ] . The metabolism of clopidogrel can also be impaired by drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, such as omeprazole or esomeprazole. Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . 5.2 General Risk of Bleeding P2Y12 inhibitors (thienopyridines), including clopidogrel, increase the risk of bleeding. P2Y12 inhibitors (thienopyridines), inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7 to 10 days). Because the half-life of clopidogrel’s active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective. Use of drugs that induce the activity of CYP2C19 would be expected to result in increased drug levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and might potentiate the bleeding risk. As a precaution, avoid concomitant use of strong CYP2C19 inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Risk factors for bleeding include concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.4 , 7.5 , 7.6 , 7.7) ] . 5.3 Discontinuation of Clopidogrel Discontinuation of clopidogrel increases the risk of cardiovascular events. If clopidogrel must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for surgery with a major risk of bleeding), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with clopidogrel for five days prior to such surgery. Resume clopidogrel as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.4 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) TTP, sometimes fatal, has been reported following use of clopidogrel, sometimes after a short exposure (<2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). It is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragmented RBCs] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.5 Cross-Reactivity among Thienopyridines Hypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving clopidogrel, including patients with a history of hypersensitivity or hematologic reaction to other thienopyridines [see Contraindications (4.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] ."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP2C19 inducers: Increases levels of clopidogrel active metabolite and increases platelet inhibition. ( 7.1 ) Opioids: Decreased exposure to clopidogrel. Consider use of parenteral antiplatelet agent. ( 7.3 ) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs): Increases risk of bleeding. ( 7.4 , 7.5 , 7.6 ) Other Antiplatelet Agents: Increases the risk of bleeding due to an additive effect. ( 7.7 ) Repaglinide (CYP2C8 substrates): Increases substrate plasma concentrations. ( 7.8 ) 7.1 CYP2C19 Inducers Since clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of drugs that induce the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in increased drug levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel. Rifampin strongly induces CYP2C19 resulting to both an increase level of clopidogrel active metabolite and platelet inhibition, which in particular might potentiate the risk of bleeding. As a precaution, avoid concomitant use of strong CYP2C19 inducers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Omeprazole or Esomeprazole Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In clinical studies, omeprazole was shown to reduce significantly the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel when given concomitantly or 12 hours apart. A similar reduction in antiplatelet activity was observed with esomeprazole when given concomitantly with clopidogrel. Dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole had less effect on the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel than did omeprazole or esomeprazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, coadministration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of clopidogrel, presumably because of slowed gastric emptying, resulting in reduced exposure to its metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Consider the use of a parenteral antiplatelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring coadministration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Coadministration of clopidogrel and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. 7.5 Warfarin (CYP2C9 Substrates) Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) or INR in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of clopidogrel with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis. However, at high concentrations in vitro , clopidogrel inhibits CYP2C9. 7.6 SSRIs and SNRIs Since selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) affect platelet activation, the concomitant administration of SSRIs and SNRIs with clopidogrel may increase the risk of bleeding. 7.7 Other Antiplatelet Agents Coadministration of antiplatelet agents increase the risk of bleeding due to an additive effect. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss if patients are treated concomitantly with other antiplatelet agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 7.8 Repaglinide (CYP2C8 Substrates) The acyl-β-glucuronide metabolite of clopidogrel is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8. Clopidogrel can increase the systemic exposure to drugs that are primarily cleared by CYP2C8, thereby needing dose adjustment and appropriate monitoring. Clopidogrel increased repaglinide exposures by 3.9-fold to 5.1-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid concomitant use of repaglinide with clopidogrel. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, initiate repaglinide at 0.5 mg before each meal and do not exceed a total daily dose of 4 mg. Increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required during concomitant use."

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with dabigatran etexilate capsules who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include: • use of indwelling epidural catheters • concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants • a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures • a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery • optimal timing between the administration of dabigatran etexilate capsules and neuraxial procedures is not known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bleeding: Dabigatran etexilate can cause serious and fatal bleeding ( 5.2 ) Bioprosthetic heart valves: Dabigatran etexilate use not recommended ( 5.4 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple-Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome: Dabigatran etexilate use not recommended ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including dabigatran etexilate, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. If dabigatran etexilate capsules are discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant and restart dabigatran etexilate capsules as soon as medically appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.6, 2.7, 2.8)]. 5.2 Risk of Bleeding Dabigatran etexilate increases the risk of bleeding and can cause significant and, sometimes, fatal bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss (e.g., a drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit or hypotension). Discontinue dabigatran etexilate capsules in patients with active pathological bleeding [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Risk factors for bleeding include the concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anti-platelet agents, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs). Dabigatran etexilate’s anticoagulant activity and half-life are increased in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect: In adults, a specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) for dabigatran etexilate is available when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed: For emergency surgery/urgent procedures In life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding In pediatric patients, the efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established. Hemodialysis can remove dabigatran; however the clinical experience supporting the use of hemodialysis as a treatment for bleeding is limited [see Overdosage (10)] . Prothrombin complex concentrates, or recombinant Factor VIIa may be considered but their use has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran. Consider administration of platelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long-acting antiplatelet drugs have been used. 5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal puncture is employed, patients treated with anticoagulant agents are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis [see Boxed Warning] . To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of dabigatran etexilate and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, monitor frequently to detect any signs or symptoms of neurological impairment, such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to immediately report if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae. 5.4 Thromboembolic and Bleeding Events in Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves The safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate capsules in adult patients with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic heart valves was evaluated in the RE-ALIGN trial, in which patients with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic heart valves (recently implanted or implanted more than three months prior to enrollment) were randomized to dose adjusted warfarin or 150 mg, 220 mg, or 300 mg of dabigatran etexilate capsules twice a day. RE-ALIGN was terminated early due to the occurrence of significantly more thromboembolic events (valve thrombosis, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and myocardial infarction) and an excess of major bleeding (predominantly postoperative pericardial effusions requiring intervention for hemodynamic compromise) in the dabigatran etexilate capsules treatment arm as compared to the warfarin treatment arm. These bleeding and thromboembolic events were seen both in patients who were initiated on dabigatran etexilate capsules post-operatively within three days of mechanical bileaflet valve implantation, as well as in patients whose valves had been implanted more than three months prior to enrollment. Therefore, the use of dabigatran etexilate is contraindicated in all patients with mechanical prosthetic valves [see Contraindications (4)]. The use of dabigatran etexilate for the prophylaxis of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation in the setting of other forms of valvular heart disease, including the presence of a bioprosthetic heart valve, has not been studied and is not recommended. 5.5 Effect of P-gp Inducers and Inhibitors on Dabigatran Exposure The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin) reduces exposure to dabigatran and should generally be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . P-gp inhibition and impaired renal function are the major independent factors that result in increased exposure to dabigatran [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in patients with renal impairment is expected to produce increased exposure of dabigatran compared to that seen with either factor alone. Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Adult Patients Reduce the dosage of dabigatran etexilate capsules to 75 mg twice daily when dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole is co-administered with dabigatran etexilate capsules in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min). Avoid use of dabigatran etexilate capsules and P-gp inhibitors in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Treatment and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients Avoid use of dabigatran etexilate capsules and concomitant P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl <50 mL/min [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients Following Hip Replacement Surgery Avoid use of dabigatran etexilate capsules and concomitant P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl <50 mL/min [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Treatment and reduction in risk of recurrence of VTE in pediatric patients The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate capsules with P-gp-inhibitors has not been studied in pediatric patients but may increase exposure to dabigatran. 5.6 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple-Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including dabigatran etexilate, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS (especially those who are triple-positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy."

P-gp inhibition and impaired renal function are the major independent factors that result in increased exposure to dabigatran [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in patients with renal impairment is expected to produce increased exposure of dabigatran compared to that seen with either factor alone. In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min), reduce the dosage of dabigatran etexilate to 75 mg twice daily when administered concomitantly with the P-gp inhibitors dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole. The use of the P-gp inhibitors verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine, clarithromycin, and ticagrelor does not require a dosage adjustment of dabigatran etexilate. These results should not be extrapolated to other P-gp inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate and P-gp inhibitors in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min) should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.2 Treatment and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients Avoid use of dabigatran etexilate and P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl <50 mL/min [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.3 Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients Following Hip Replacement Surgery In patients with CrCl ≥50 mL/min who have concomitant administration of P-gp inhibitors such as dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole, it may be helpful to separate the timing of administration of dabigatran and the P-gp inhibitor by several hours. The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate and P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl <50 mL/min should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)] . 7.4 Treatment and Reduction in Risk of Recurrence of VTE in Pediatric Patients The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate capsules with P-gp inhibitors has not been studied in pediatric patients but may increase exposure to dabigatran [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] ."

    "overdose_warning": "10 OVERDOSAGE Accidental overdose may lead to hemorrhagic complications. In the event of hemorrhagic complications, initiate appropriate clinical support, discontinue treatment with dabigatran etexilate, and investigate the source of bleeding. A specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) is available for adult patients. Dabigatran is primarily eliminated by the kidneys with a low plasma protein binding of approximately 35%. Hemodialysis can remove dabigatran; however, data supporting this approach are limited. Using a high-flux dialyzer, blood flow rate of 200 mL/min, and dialysate flow rate of 700 mL/min, approximately 49% of total dabigatran can be cleared from plasma over 4 hours. At the same dialysate flow rate, approximately 57% can be cleared using a dialyzer blood flow rate of 300 mL/min, with no appreciable increase in clearance observed at higher blood flow rates. Upon cessation of hemodialysis, a redistribution effect of approximately 7% to 15% is seen. The effect of dialysis on dabigatran’s plasma concentration would be expected to vary based on patient specific characteristics. Measurement of aPTT or ECT may help guide therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].",

The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ].

    "overdose_warning": "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Human Experience Worldwide exposure to fluoxetine hydrochloride is estimated to be over 38 million patients (circa 1999). Of the 1578 cases of overdose involving fluoxetine hydrochloride, alone or with other drugs, reported from this population, there were 195 deaths. Among 633 adult patients who overdosed on fluoxetine hydrochloride alone, 34 resulted in a fatal outcome, 378 completely recovered, and 15 patients experienced sequelae after overdosage, including abnormal accommodation, abnormal gait, confusion, unresponsiveness, nervousness, pulmonary dysfunction, vertigo, tremor, elevated blood pressure, impotence, movement disorder, and hypomania. The remaining 206 patients had an unknown outcome. The most common signs and symptoms associated with non-fatal overdosage were seizures, somnolence, nausea, tachycardia, and vomiting. The largest known ingestion of fluoxetine hydrochloride in adult patients was 8 grams in a patient who took fluoxetine alone and who subsequently recovered. However, in an adult patient who took fluoxetine alone, an ingestion as low as 520 mg has been associated with lethal outcome, but causality has not been established. Among pediatric patients (ages 3 months to 17 years), there were 156 cases of overdose involving fluoxetine alone or in combination with other drugs. Six patients died, 127 patients completely recovered, 1 patient experienced renal failure, and 22 patients had an unknown outcome. One of the six fatalities was a 9-year-old boy who had a history of OCD, Tourette’s syndrome with tics, attention deficit disorder, and fetal alcohol syndrome. He had been receiving 100 mg of fluoxetine daily for 6 months in addition to clonidine, methylphenidate, and promethazine. Mixed-drug ingestion or other methods of suicide complicated all 6 overdoses in children that resulted in fatalities. The largest ingestion in pediatric patients was 3 grams which was nonlethal. Other important adverse reactions reported with fluoxetine overdose (single or multiple drugs) include coma, delirium, ECG abnormalities (such as nodal rhythm, QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, including Torsades de Pointes-type arrhythmias), hypotension, mania, neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like reactions, pyrexia, stupor, and syncope. 10.2 Animal Experience Studies in animals do not provide precise or necessarily valid information about the treatment of human overdose. However, animal experiments can provide useful insights into possible treatment strategies. The oral median lethal dose in rats and mice was found to be 452 and 248 mg/kg, respectively. Acute high oral doses produced hyperirritability and convulsions in several animal species. Among 6 dogs purposely overdosed with oral fluoxetine, 5 experienced grand mal seizures. Seizures stopped immediately upon the bolus intravenous administration of a standard veterinary dose of diazepam. In this short-term study, the lowest plasma concentration at which a seizure occurred was only twice the maximum plasma concentration seen in humans taking 80 mg/day, chronically. In a separate single-dose study, the ECG of dogs given high doses did not reveal prolongation of the PR, QRS, or QT intervals. Tachycardia and an increase in blood pressure were observed. Consequently, the value of the ECG in predicting cardiac toxicity is unknown. Nonetheless, the ECG should ordinarily be monitored in cases of human overdose [see Overdosage (10.3) ] . 10.3 Management of Overdose For current information on the management of fluoxetine overdose, contact a certified poison control center (1-800-222-1222 or www.poison.org). Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug. Consider the possibility of multi-drug overdose. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Use general supportive and symptomatic measures. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for fluoxetine are known. A specific caution involves patients who are taking or have recently taken fluoxetine and might ingest excessive quantities of a TCA. In such a case, accumulation of the parent tricyclic and/or an active metabolite may increase the possibility of clinically significant sequelae and extend the time needed for close medical observation [see Drug Interactions (7.7) ] .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity : Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop ( 5.3 ) Hypertension : Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure ( 5.4 , 7 ) Heart Failure and Edema : Avoid use of flurbiprofen in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure ( 5.5 ) Renal Toxicity : Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid use of flurbiprofen in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function ( 5.6 ) Anaphylactic Reactions : Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs ( 5.7 ) Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity : Flurbiprofen is contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity) ( 5.8 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Discontinue flurbiprofen at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity ( 5.9 ) Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) : Discontinue and evaluate clinically ( 5.10 ). Fetal Toxicity : Limit use of NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen tablets, between about 20 to 30 weeks in pregnancy due to the risk of oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction. Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy due to the risks of oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus ( 5.11 , 8.1 ). Hematologic Toxicity : Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as flurbiprofen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of flurbiprofen in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If flurbiprofen is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-times increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue flurbiprofen until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported. Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including flurbiprofen. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue flurbiprofen immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. 5.4 Hypertension NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [ see Drug Interactions ( 5.1 , 7 ) ]. Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.5 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of flurbiprofen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Avoid the use of flurbiprofen in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If flurbiprofen is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. In clinical studies, the elimination half-life of flurbiprofen was unchanged in patients with renal impairment. Flurbiprofen metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. Elimination of 4’-hydroxy-flurbiprofen was reduced in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Therefore, treatment with flurbiprofen is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If flurbiprofen therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patients renal function is advisable [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ]. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating flurbiprofen. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of flurbiprofen [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Avoid the use of flurbiprofen in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If flurbiprofen is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions Flurbiprofen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to flurbiprofen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, flurbiprofen is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. When flurbiprofen is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.9 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of flurbiprofen at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Flurbiprofen is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.10 Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as flurbiprofen tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue flurbiprofen tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.11 Fetal Toxicity Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus : Avoid use of NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen tablets, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment : Use of NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen tablets, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit flurbiprofen tablets use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if flurbiprofen tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue flurbiprofen tablets if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ]. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with flurbiprofen has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders of concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of flurbiprofen in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.6 ) ]. 5.15 Vision Changes Blurred and/or diminished vision has been reported with the use of flurbiprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients experiencing eye complaints should have ophthalmologic examinations."

Limitations of Use : Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol Multi-Dose Dry Powder Inhaler (MDPI) is a combination of fluticasone propionate, a corticosteroid, and salmeterol, a long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABA), indicated for treatment of asthma in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol inhalation powder should be used for patients not adequately controlled on a long term asthma control medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid or whose disease warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and long acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABA). ( 1 ) Limitations of Use : Not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. ( 1 )",
    "warnings": [
      "5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life‑threatening episodes of asthma. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating asthma. The initiation of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI in this setting is not appropriate. Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported when salmeterol, a component of this product, has been initiated in patients with significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. In most cases, these have occurred in patients with severe asthma (e.g., patients with a history of corticosteroid dependence, low pulmonary function, intubation, mechanical ventilation, frequent hospitalizations, previous life‑threatening acute asthma exacerbations) and in some patients with acutely deteriorating asthma (e.g., patients with significantly increasing symptoms; increasing need for inhaled, short‑acting beta 2 ‑agonists; decreasing response to usual medications; increasing need for systemic corticosteroids; recent emergency room visits; deteriorating lung function). However, these events have occurred in a few patients with less severe asthma as well. It was not possible from these reports to determine whether salmeterol contributed to these events. Increasing use of inhaled, short‑acting beta 2 ‑agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for replacing the current strength of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, or initiating systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation twice daily of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. An inhaled, short‑acting beta 2 ‑agonist, not Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath. When prescribing Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short‑acting beta 2 -agonist (e.g., albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms, despite regular twice‑daily use of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. When beginning treatment with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short‑acting beta 2 ‑agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs.",
      "5.3 Avoid Excessive Use of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol and Avoid Use with Other Long-Acting Beta 2 -Agonists Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.",
      "5.4 Oropharyngeal Candidiasis In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred in subjects treated with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI continues, but at times therapy with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.",
      "5.5 Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible adolescents or adults using corticosteroids. In such patients who have not had these diseases or who have not been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.",
      "5.6 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy HPA Suppression/Adrenal Insufficiency Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies. During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physician for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a medical identification warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack. Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV 1 ] or morning peak expiratory flow [AM PEF]), beta‑agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension. Unmasking of Allergic Conditions Previously Suppressed by Systemic Corticosteroids Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). Corticosteroid Withdrawal Symptoms During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.",
      "5.7 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression Fluticasone propionate, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since fluticasone propionate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. A relationship between plasma levels of fluticasone propionate and inhibitory effects on stimulated cortisol production has been shown after 4 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response. It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids, and for management of asthma symptoms.",
      "5.8 Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].",
      "5.9 Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms As with other inhaled medicines, Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life‑threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol medicines, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol medicines should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted. Upper airway symptoms of laryngeal spasm, irritation, or swelling, such as stridor and choking, have been reported in patients receiving inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol medicines.",
      "5.10 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powder products containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI [see Contraindications ( 4 )].",
      "5.11 Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System Effects Excessive beta‑adrenergic stimulation has been associated with seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia [see Overdosage ]. Therefore, Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, like all products containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Salmeterol, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of salmeterol at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta‑agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Large doses of inhaled or oral salmeterol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.",
      "5.12 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long‑term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long‑term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care.",
      "5.13 Effect on Growth Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, titrate each patient’s dosage to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] .",
      "5.14 Glaucoma and Cataracts Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Effects of treatment with other fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, salmeterol 50 mcg, or placebo on development of cataracts or glaucoma was evaluated in a subset of 658 subjects with COPD in the 3-year survival trial. Ophthalmic examinations were conducted at baseline and at 48, 108, and 158 weeks. Conclusions about cataracts cannot be drawn from this trial because the high incidence of cataracts at baseline (61% to 71%) resulted in an inadequate number of subjects treated with other fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg who were eligible and available for evaluation of cataracts at the end of the trial (n = 53). The incidence of newly diagnosed glaucoma was 2% with other fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, 5% with fluticasone propionate, 0% with salmeterol, and 2% with placebo.",
      "5.15 Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome In rare cases, patients on inhaled fluticasone propionate, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg‑Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of fluticasone propionate. Cases of serious eosinophilic conditions have also been reported with other inhaled corticosteroids in this clinical setting. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between fluticasone propionate and these underlying conditions has not been established.",
      "5.16 Coexisting Conditions Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta 2 ‑adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.",
      "5.17 Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia Beta‑adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Clinically significant changes in blood glucose and/or serum potassium were seen infrequently during clinical trials with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI at recommended doses."

      "7.1 Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol, the individual components of this product, are substrates of CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur. Ritonavir : Fluticasone Propionate: A drug interaction trial with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression. Ketoconazole : Fluticasone Propionate: Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in a 1.9‑fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45% decrease in plasma cortisol area under the curve (AUC) but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. Salmeterol: In a drug interaction trial in 20 healthy subjects, coadministration of inhaled salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and oral ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in greater systemic exposure to salmeterol (AUC increased 16‑fold and C max increased 1.4‑fold). Three (3) subjects were withdrawn due to beta 2 ‑agonist side effects (2 with prolonged QTc and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .",
      "7.2 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of salmeterol, a component of this product, on the vascular system may be potentiated by these agents.",
      "7.4 Non-Potassium-Sparing Diuretics The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non–potassium‑sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta‑agonists, such as salmeterol, a component of this product, especially when the recommended dose of the beta‑agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI with non-potassium‑sparing diuretics."

      "note": "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For oral inhalation only. ( 2.1 ) Starting dosage is based on prior asthma therapy and disease severity. ( 2.2 ) 1 inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol 55 mcg/14 mcg, 113 mcg/14 mcg, or 232 mcg/14 mcg twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Do not use with a spacer or volume holding chamber. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Administration Instructions Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is for oral inhalation and does not require priming. Do not use Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI with a spacer or volume holding chamber. Do not use more than two times every 24 hours. More frequent administration or a greater number of daily inhalations (more than one inhalation twice daily) is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse reactions with higher salmeterol dosages. Avoid the concomitant use of other long acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABAs) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.11 )]. If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist should be taken for immediate relief. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Administer 1 inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI twice daily by oral inhalation (approximately 12 hours apart at the same time every day). Rinse the mouth with water without swallowing after each inhalation. Dosage Selection The recommended starting dosage for Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is based on asthma severity and current inhaled corticosteroid use and strength. Patients not taking inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (with less severe asthma): 1 inhalation of 55 mcg/14 mcg Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI dose strength (55 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 14 mcg of salmeterol), twice daily by oral inhalation. Patients with greater asthma severity, use the higher dose strengths: 1 inhalation of 113 mcg/14 mcg Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI (113 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 14 mcg of salmeterol) twice daily; or 1 inhalation of 232 mcg/14 mcg Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI (232 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 14 mcg of salmeterol) twice daily Patients switching to Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI from another inhaled corticosteroid or combination product: 1 inhalation of low (55 mcg/14 mcg), medium (113 mcg/14 mcg) or high (232 mcg/14 mcg) Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI twice daily by oral inhalation based on the strength of the previous inhaled corticosteroid product, or the strength of the inhaled corticosteroid from a combination product, and disease severity. The maximum recommended dosage of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is 232 mcg/14 mcg twice daily. General Dosing Information Improvement in asthma control following Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI administration can occur within 15 minutes of beginning treatment; although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 week or longer after starting treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI after 2 weeks of therapy, consider increasing the strength (replace with higher strength) to possibly provide additional improvement in asthma control. If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide adequate improvement in asthma control, re-evaluate the therapeutic regimen, including patient compliance and inhaler technique, and consider additional therapeutic options (e.g., increasing the dose of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI with a higher strength, adding additional controller therapies). After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the risk of adverse reactions. 2.3 Storing and Cleaning the Inhaler Keep the inhaler in a cool dry place. Routine maintenance is not required. If the mouthpiece needs cleaning, gently wipe the mouthpiece with a dry cloth or tissue as needed. Never wash or put any part of the inhaler in water. 2.4 Dose Counter The Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI has a dose counter: The number 60 is displayed (prior to use). The dose counter will count down each time the mouthpiece is opened and closed [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )].",

    "overdose_warning": "10 OVERDOSAGE This product contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta‑receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases of overdosage. Fluticasone propionate Chronic overdosage of fluticasone propionate may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Salmeterol The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of salmeterol are those of excessive beta‑adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms of beta‑adrenergic stimulation (e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis). Overdosage with salmeterol can lead to clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which can produce ventricular arrhythmias. As with all inhaled sympathomimetic medicines, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with an overdose of salmeterol.",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increases in Blood Pressure : Can increase blood pressure in adult patients. Periodically monitor blood pressure, especially in hypertensive patients. Mirabegron extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention in Patients With Bladder Outlet Obstruction and in Patients Taking Muscarinic Antagonist Drugs for Overactive Bladder : Administer with caution in these patients because of risk of urinary retention. ( 5.2 ) Angioedema : Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with mirabegron. ( 5.3 , 6.2 ) 5.1 Increases in Blood Pressure Increases in Blood Pressure in Adults Mirabegron extended-release tablets can increase blood pressure. Periodic blood pressure determinations are recommended, especially in hypertensive patients. Mirabegron extended-release tablets are not recommended for use in patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. In two, randomized, placebo-controlled, healthy adult volunteer studies, mirabegron extended-release tablets were associated with dose-related increases in supine blood pressure. In these studies, at the maximum recommended dose of 50 mg, the mean maximum increase in systolic/diastolic blood pressure was approximately 3.5/1.5 mm Hg greater than placebo. In contrast, in adult OAB patients in clinical trials, mirabegron extended-release tablets, taken as monotherapy, the mean increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the maximum recommended mirabegron dose of 50 mg was approximately 0.5 to 1 mm Hg greater than placebo. Worsening of pre-existing hypertension was reported infrequently in patients taking mirabegron extended-release tablets. Increases in Blood Pressure in Pediatric Patients 3 Years and Older Mirabegron extended-release tablets can increase blood pressure in pediatric patients. Blood pressure increases may be larger in children (3 to less than 12 years of age) than in adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age). Periodic blood pressure determinations are recommended. Mirabegron extended-release tablets is not recommended for use in pediatric patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension, defined as a systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure above the 99 th percentile plus 5 mm Hg for age, sex, and stature using appropriate reference values. Pediatric use information is approved for Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.'s MYRBETRIQ (mirabegron extended-release tablets). However, due to Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.2 Urinary Retention in Patients with Bladder Outlet Obstruction and in Patients Taking Muscarinic Antagonist Medications for OAB In patients taking mirabegron extended-release tablets, urinary retention has been reported to occur in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and in patients taking muscarinic antagonist medications for the treatment of OAB. A controlled clinical safety study in patients with BOO did not demonstrate increased urinary retention in patients treated with mirabegron; however, mirabegron extended-release tablets should still be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant BOO. For example, monitor these patients for signs and symptoms of urinary retention. Mirabegron extended-release tablets should also be administered with caution to patients taking muscarinic antagonist medications for the treatment of OAB [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . 5.3 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with mirabegron extended-release tablets. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema, associated with upper airway swelling, may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue mirabegron extended-release tablets and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . 5.4 Patients Taking Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 Since mirabegron extended-release tablet is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, the systemic exposure to CYP2D6 substrates is increased when coadministered with mirabegron extended-release tablet. Therefore, appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary, especially with narrow therapeutic index drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 : Mirabegron is a CYP2D6 inhibitor and, when used concomitantly with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6, especially narrow therapeutic index drugs, appropriate monitoring and possible dose adjustment of those drugs may be necessary. ( 5.4 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) Digoxin : When initiating a combination of mirabegron and digoxin, use the lowest dose of digoxin; monitor serum digoxin concentrations to titrate digoxin dose to desired clinical effect. ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) Pediatric use information is approved for Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.'s MYRBETRIQ (mirabegron extended-release tablets). However, due to Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. Drug interaction studies were conducted in adult patients to investigate the effect of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron and the effect of mirabegron on the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs (e.g., ketoconazole, rifampin, solifenacin succinate, tamsulosin, and oral contraceptives) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . No dose adjustment is recommended when these drugs are coadministered with mirabegron. The following are drug interactions for which monitoring is recommended: 7.1 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 Since mirabegron is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, the systemic exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 enzyme is increased when coadministered with mirabegron. Therefore, appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary when mirabegron extended-release tablet is coadministered with these drugs, especially with narrow therapeutic index CYP2D6 substrates [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Digoxin When given in combination, 100 mg mirabegron increased mean digoxin C max from 1.01 to 1.3 ng/mL (29%) and AUC from 16.7 to 19.3 ng.h/mL (27%). For patients who are initiating a combination of mirabegron and digoxin, the lowest dose for digoxin should initially be considered. Serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of the digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Warfarin The mean C max of S - and R -warfarin was increased by approximately 4% and AUC by approximately 9% when administered as a single dose of 25 mg after multiple doses of 100 mg mirabegron. Following a single dose administration of 25 mg warfarin, mirabegron had no effect on the warfarin pharmacodynamic endpoints such as International Normalized Ratio (INR) and prothrombin time. However, the effect of mirabegron on multiple doses of warfarin and on warfarin pharmacodynamic end points such as INR and prothrombin time has not been fully investigated [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "warnings": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share a BASAGLAR prefilled pen between patients, even if the needle is changed. ( 5.1 ) Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Make changes to a patient's insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. ( 5.2 ) Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, co-administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness. ( 5.3 , 6.1 ) Hypoglycemia due to medication errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. ( 5.4 ) Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue BASAGLAR, monitor and treat if indicated. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. ( 5.6 ) Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Never Share a BASAGLAR Prefilled Pen Between Patients BASAGLAR prefilled pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including BASAGLAR [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). BASAGLAR, or any insulin, should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of BASAGLAR may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . The risk of hypoglycemia generally increases with intensity of glycemic control. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. The long-acting effect of BASAGLAR may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between BASAGLAR and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including BASAGLAR. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue BASAGLAR; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . BASAGLAR is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or one of the excipients [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including BASAGLAR, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including BASAGLAR, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ) Administer subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, but at the same time every day. ( 2.2 ) Rotate injection sites into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. ( 2.1 ) Closely monitor glucose when converting to BASAGLAR and during initial weeks thereafter. ( 2.2 ) Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Always check insulin labels before administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Visually inspect BASAGLAR prefilled pens for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Only use if the solution is clear and colorless with no visible particles. Administer BASAGLAR subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid, and rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . During changes to a patient's insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Use BASAGLAR with caution in patients with visual impairment that may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. Do not dilute or mix BASAGLAR with any other insulin or solution. Do not administer intravenously or via an insulin pump. 2.2 General Dosing Instructions In patients with type 1 diabetes, BASAGLAR must be used concomitantly with short-acting insulin. Inject BASAGLAR subcutaneously once daily at any time of day but at the same time every day. Individualize and adjust the dosage of BASAGLAR based on the individual's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), during acute illness, or changes in renal or hepatic function. Dosage adjustments should only be made under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The BASAGLAR prefilled pens each dials in 1 unit increments and delivers a maximum dose of 80 units per injection. 2.3 Initiation of BASAGLAR Therapy The recommended starting dose of BASAGLAR in patients with type 1 diabetes should be approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Short- or rapid-acting, pre-meal insulin should be used to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements. The recommended starting dose of BASAGLAR in patients with type 2 diabetes is 0.2 units/kg or up to 10 units once daily. 2.4 Changing to BASAGLAR from Other Insulin Therapies If changing patients from another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, to BASAGLAR, the dose of BASAGLAR should be the same as the other insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL. If changing patients from a once-daily insulin glargine product, 300 units/mL, to once-daily BASAGLAR, the recommended initial BASAGLAR dosage is 80% of the insulin glargine product, 300 units/mL [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate- or long-acting insulin to a regimen with BASAGLAR, a change in the dose of the basal insulin may be required. If changing patients from twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily BASAGLAR, the recommended initial BASAGLAR dosage is 80% of the total daily NPH dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] .",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastric Malignancy : In adults, symptomatic response with lansoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing ( 5.1 ) Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis : Discontinue treatment and evaluate patients. ( 5.2 ) Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea : PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. ( 5.3 ) Bone Fracture : Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5) Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus : Mostly cutaneous; new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue lansoprazole and refer to specialist for evaluation. ( 5.6 ) Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency : Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. ( 5.7 ) Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism : Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs. ( 5.8 ) Interactions with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors : Increases in intragastric pH may result in hypergastrinemia and enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased chromogranin A levels which may interfere with diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. ( 5.9 , 7 ) Interaction with Methotrexate : Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity. With high-dose methotrexate administration, consider a temporary withdrawal of lansoprazole. (5.10 , 7 ) Fundic Gland Polyps : Risk increases with long-term use, especially beyond 1 year. Use the shortest duration of therapy. ( 5.12 ) Risk of Heart Valve Thickening in Pediatric Patients Less than One Year of Age : lansoprazole delayed-release capsules are not recommended in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. ( 5.13 , 8.4) 5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with lansoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy. 5.2 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea, anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia). Discontinue Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.3 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy like lansoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD), especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. CDAD has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents. For more information specific to antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated for use in combination with lansoprazole, refer to WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections of their prescribing information. 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of PPIs [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including lansoprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE. The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported. Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving lansoprazole, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in four to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations. 5.7 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than three years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with lansoprazole delayed released capsules. 5.8 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium, as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI. 5.9 Interactions with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop lansoprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] . 5.10 Interaction with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [ see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 5.12 Fundic Gland Polyps PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.13 Risk of Heart Valve Thickening in Pediatric Patients Less Than One Year of Age Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules are not approved in pediatric patients less than one year of age. Nonclinical studies in juvenile rats with lansoprazole have demonstrated an adverse effect of heart valve thickening. The risk of heart valve injury does not appear to be relevant to patients one year of age and older [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] .",
      "5.6 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including lansoprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE. The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly.

      "5.7 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than three years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with lansoprazole delayed released capsules."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Thyroid hormone preparations are generally contraindicated in patients with diagnosed but as yet uncorrected adrenal cortical insufficiency, untreated thyrotoxicosis, and apparent hypersensitivity to any of their active or extraneous constituents. There is no well-documented evidence from the literature, however, of true allergic or idiosyncratic reactions to thyroid hormone."
    ],
    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Oral Anticoagulants — Thyroid hormones appear to increase catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. If oral anticoagulants are also being given, compensatory increases in clotting factor synthesis are impaired. Patients stabilized on oral anticoagulants who are found to require thyroid replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started. If a patient is truly hypothyroid, it is likely that a reduction in anticoagulant dosage will be required. No special precautions appear to be necessary when oral anticoagulant therapy is begun in a patient already stabilized on maintenance thyroid replacement therapy. Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemics — Initiating thyroid replacement therapy may cause increases in insulin or oral hypoglycemic requirements. The effects seen are poorly understood and depend upon a variety of factors such as dose and type of thyroid preparations and endocrine status of the patient. Patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemics should be closely watched during initiation of thyroid replacement therapy. Cholestyramine or Colestipol - Cholestyramine or colestipol binds both T 4 and T 3 in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones. In vitro studies indicate that the binding is not easily removed. Therefore, four to five hours should elapse between administration of cholestyramine and thyroid hormones. Estrogen, Oral Contraceptives — Estrogens tend to increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBg). In a patient with a nonfunctioning thyroid gland who is receiving thyroid replacement therapy, free levothyroxine may be decreased when estrogens are started thus increasing thyroid requirements. However, if the patient’s thyroid gland has sufficient function, the decreased free levothyroxine will result in a compensatory increase in levothyroxine output by the thyroid. Therefore, patients without a functioning thyroid gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given."

    "overdose_warning": "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms - Excessive doses of thyroid result in a hypermetabolic state resembling in every respect the condition of endogenous origin. The condition may be self-induced. Treatment of Overdosage - Dosage should be reduced or therapy temporarily discontinued if signs and symptoms of overdosage appear. Treatment may be reinstituted at a lower dosage. In normal individuals, normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function is restored in 6 to 8 weeks after thyroid suppression. Treatment of acute massive thyroid hormone overdosage is aimed at reducing gastrointestinal absorption of the drugs and counteracting central and peripheral effects, mainly those of increased sympathetic activity. Vomiting may be induced initially if further gastrointestinal absorption can reasonably be prevented and barring contraindications such as coma, convulsions, or loss of the gagging reflex. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Oxygen may be administered and ventilation maintained. Cardiac glycosides may be indicated if congestive heart failure develops. Measures to control fever, hypoglycemia, or fluid loss should be instituted if needed. Antiadrenergic agents, particularly propranolol, have been used advantageously in the treatment of increased sympathetic activity. Propranolol may be administered intravenously at a dosage of 1 to 3 mg, over a 10-minute period or orally, 80 to 160 mg/day, initially, especially when no contraindications exist for its use. Other adjunctive measures may include administration of cholestyramine to interfere with thyroxine absorption, and glucocorticoids to inhibit conversions of T 4 to T 3 .",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic Acidosis: See boxed warning . ( 5.1 ) Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue ZITUVIMET. ( 5.2 ) Heart Failure : Has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of ZITUVIMET in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.3 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiating ZITUVIMET and at least annually thereafter, assess renal function. ( 5.4 ) Vitamin B 12 Deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters annually and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. ( 5.5 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.6 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop ZITUVIMET, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.7 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.8 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue ZITUVIMET. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of ZITUVIMET. In ZITUVIMET treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue ZITUVIMET and report these symptoms to their health care provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]: Before initiating ZITUVIMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). ZITUVIMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. ZITUVIMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed combination ZITUVIMET product. Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking ZITUVIMET. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of ZITUVIMET with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Radiological Studies with Contrast Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop ZITUVIMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart ZITUVIMET if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. ZITUVIMET should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue ZITUVIMET. Excessive Alcohol Intake Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving ZITUVIMET. Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of ZITUVIMET in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking ZITUVIMET. After initiation of ZITUVIMET, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, sitagliptin should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using ZITUVIMET. 5.3 Heart Failure An association between DPP-4 inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of ZITUVIMET prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of ZITUVIMET. 5.4 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiation of therapy with ZITUVIMET and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed. In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated, particularly in elderly patients, renal function should be assessed more frequently and ZITUVIMET discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present. ZITUVIMET is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 5.5 Vitamin B12 Deficiency In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 measurements at 2- to 3-year intervals in patients on ZITUVIMET and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.6 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues ZITUVIMET may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with ZITUVIMET [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin, one of the components of ZITUVIMET. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with sitagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue ZITUVIMET, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with ZITUVIMET. 5.8 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.9 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP- 4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving ZITUVIMET. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, ZITUVIMET should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

Employ the usual supportive measures dictated by the patient's clinical status. Per clinical judgement, consider removal of unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, and clinical monitoring (including obtaining an ECG). Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis. Overdose of metformin has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions.

    "content": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE The use of Metoclopramide Oral Solution is recommended for adults only. Therapy should not exceed 12 weeks in duration. Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Metoclopramide Oral Solution is indicated as short-term (4 to 12 weeks) therapy for adults with symptomatic, documented gastroesophageal reflux who fail to respond to conventional therapy. The principal effect of metoclopramide is on symptoms of post-prandial and daytime heartburn with less observed effect on nocturnal symptoms. If symptoms are confined to particular situations, such as following the evening meal, use of metoclopramide as single doses prior to the provocative situation should be considered, rather than using the drug throughout the day. Healing of esophageal ulcers and erosions has been endoscopically demonstrated at the end of 12-week trial using doses of 15 mg 4 times daily. As there is no documented correlation between symptoms and healing of esophageal lesions, patients with documented lesions should be monitored endoscopically. Diabetic Gastroparesis (Diabetic Gastric Stasis) Metoclopramide is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastric stasis. The usual manifestations of delayed gastric emptying (e.g., nausea, vomiting, heartburn, persistent fullness after meals, and anorexia) appear to respond to metoclopramide within different time intervals. Significant relief of nausea occurs early and continues to improve over a three-week period. Relief of vomiting and anorexia may precede the relief of abdominal fullness by one week or more.",

      "WARNING: TARDIVE DYSKINESIA Treatment with metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia, a serious movement disorder that is often irreversible. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose. Metoclopramide therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. There is no known treatment for tardive dyskinesia. In some patients, symptoms may lessen or resolve after metoclopramide treatment is stopped. Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia. See WARNINGS",
      "WARNINGS Mental depression has occurred in patients with and without prior history of depression. Symptoms have ranged from mild to severe and have included suicidal ideation and suicide. Metoclopramide should be given to patients with a prior history of depression only if the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks. Extrapyramidal symptoms, manifested primarily as acute dystonic reactions, occur in approximately 1 in 500 patients treated with the usual adult dosages of 30 to 40 mg/day of metoclopramide. These usually are seen during the first 24 to 48 hours of treatment with metoclopramide, occur more frequently in pediatric patients and adult patients less than 30 years of age and are even more frequent at the higher doses. These symptoms may include involuntary movements of limbs and facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, dystonic reactions may present as stridor and dyspnea, possibly due to laryngospasm. If these symptoms should occur, inject 50 mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride intramuscularly, and they usually will subside. Benztropine mesylate, 1 to 2 mg intramuscularly, may also be used to reverse these reactions. Parkinsonian-like symptoms have occurred, more commonly within the first 6 months after beginning treatment with metoclopramide, but occasionally after longer periods. These symptoms generally subside within 2 to 3 months following discontinuance of metoclopramide. Patients with preexisting Parkinson’s disease should be given metoclopramide cautiously, if at all, since such patients may experience exacerbation of parkinsonian symptoms when taking metoclopramide. Tardive Dyskinesia (see Boxed Warnings) Treatment with metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a potentially irreversible and disfiguring disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, or extremities. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose. An analysis of utilization patterns showed that about 20% of patients who used metoclopramide took it for longer than 12 weeks. Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than the recommended 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing TD. Although the risk of developing TD in the general population may be increased among the elderly, women, and diabetics, it is not possible to predict which patients will develop metoclopramide-induced TD. Both the risk of developing TD and the likelihood that TD will become irreversible increase with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose. Metoclopramide should be discontinued in patients who develop signs or symptoms of TD. There is no known effective treatment for established cases of TD, although in some patients, TD may remit, partially or completely, within several weeks to months after metoclopramide is withdrawn. Metoclopramide itself may suppress, or partially suppress, the signs of TD, thereby masking the underlying disease process. The effect of this symptomatic suppression upon the long term course of TD is unknown. Therefore, metoclopramide should not be used for the symptomatic control of TD. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) There have been rare reports of an uncommon but potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) associated with metoclopramide. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac arrhythmias). The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of metoclopramide and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Bromocriptine and dantrolene sodium have been used in treatment of NMS, but their effectiveness have not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS )."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Metoclopramide should not be used whenever stimulation of gastrointestinal motility might be dangerous, e.g., in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation. Metoclopramide is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma because the drug may cause a hypertensive crisis, probably due to release of catecholamines from the tumor. Such hypertensive crises may be controlled by phentolamine. Metoclopramide is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity or intolerance to the drug. Metoclopramide should not be used in epileptics or patients receiving other drugs which are likely to cause extrapyramidal reactions, since the frequency and severity of seizures or extrapyramidal reactions may be increased."
    ],
    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility are antagonized by anticholinergic drugs and narcotic analgesics. Additive sedative effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics, or tranquilizers. The finding that metoclopramide releases catecholamines in patients with essential hypertension suggests that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished (e.g. digoxin) by metoclopramide, whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g., acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, ethanol, cyclosporine). Gastroparesis (gastric stasis) may be responsible for poor diabetic control in some patients. Exogenously administered insulin may begin to act before food has left the stomach and lead to hypoglycemia. Because the action of metoclopramide will influence the delivery of food to the intestines and thus the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment."

    "side_effects": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In general, the incidence of adverse reactions correlates with the dose and duration of metoclopramide administration. The following reactions have been reported, although in most instances, data do not permit an estimate of frequency: CNS Effects Restlessness, drowsiness, fatigue, and lassitude occur in approximately 10% of patients receiving the most commonly prescribed dosage of 10 mg 4 times daily. (see PRECAUTIONS ). Insomnia, headache, confusion, dizziness or mental depression with suicidal ideation (see WARNINGS ) occur less frequently. The incidence of drowsiness is greater at higher doses. There are isolated reports of convulsive seizures without clearcut relationship to metoclopramide. Rarely, hallucinations have been reported. Extrapyramidal Reactions (EPS) Acute dystonic reactions, the most common type of EPS associated with metoclopramide, occur in approximately 0.2% of patients (1 in 500) treated with 30 to 40 mg of metoclopramide per day. Symptoms include involuntary movements of limbs, facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, opisthotonus (tetanus-like reactions), and, rarely, stridor and dyspnea possibly due to laryngospasm; ordinarily these symptoms are readily reversed by diphenhydramine (see WARNINGS ). Parkinsonian-like symptoms may include bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, mask-like facies (see WARNINGS ). Tardive dyskinesia most frequently is characterized by involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth, or jaw, and sometimes by involuntary movements of the trunk and/or extremities; movements may be choreoathetotic in appearance (see WARNINGS ). Motor restlessness (akathisia) may consist of feelings of anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, and insomnia, as well as inability to sit still, pacing, foot tapping. These symptoms may disappear spontaneously or respond to a reduction in dosage. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Rare occurrences of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported. This potentially fatal syndrome is comprised of the symptom complex of hyperthermia, altered consciousness, muscular rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction (see WARNINGS ). Endocrine Disturbances Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, impotence secondary to hyperprolactinemia (see PRECAUTIONS ). Fluid retention secondary to transient elevation of aldosterone (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Cardiovascular Hypotension, hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, fluid retention, acute congestive heart failure, and possible AV block (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Gastrointestinal Nausea and bowel disturbances, primarily diarrhea. Hepatic Rarely, cases of hepatotoxicity, characterized by such findings as jaundice and altered liver function tests, when metoclopramide was administered with other drugs with known hepatotoxic potential. Renal Urinary frequency and incontinence. Hematologic A few cases of neutropenia, leukopenia, or agranulocytosis, generally without clearcut relationship to metoclopramide. Methemoglobinemia, in adults and especially with overdosage in neonates (see OVERDOSAGE ). Sulfhemoglobinemia in adults. Allergic Reactions A few cases of rash, urticaria, or bronchospasm, especially in patients with a history of asthma. Rarely, angioneurotic edema, including glossal or laryngeal edema. Miscellaneous Visual disturbances. Porphyria."

      "note": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Therapy with metoclopramide oral solution should not exceed 12 weeks in duration. For the Relief of Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Administer from 10 mg to 15 mg metoclopramide orally up to 4 times daily 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime, depending upon symptoms being treated and clinical response (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). If symptoms occur only intermittently or at specific times of the day, use of metoclopramide in single doses up to 20 mg prior to the provoking situation may be preferred rather than continuous treatment. Occasionally, patients (such as elderly patients) who are more sensitive to the therapeutic or adverse effects of metoclopramide will require only 5 mg per dose. Experience with esophageal erosions and ulcerations is limited, but healing has thus far been documented in one controlled trial using 4 times daily therapy at 15 mg/dose, and this regimen should be used when lesions are present, so long as it is tolerated (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Because of the poor correlation between symptoms and endoscopic appearance of the esophagus, therapy directed at esophageal lesions is best guided by endoscopic evaluation. Therapy longer than 12 weeks has not been evaluated and cannot be recommended. For the Relief of Symptoms Associated with Diabetic Gastroparesis (Diabetic Gastric Stasis) Administer 10 mg of metoclopramide 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime for two to eight weeks, depending upon response and the likelihood of continued well-being upon drug discontinuation. The initial route of administration should be determined by the severity of the presenting symptoms. If only the earliest manifestations of diabetic gastric stasis are present, oral administration of metoclopramide may be initiated. However, if severe symptoms are present, therapy should begin with metoclopramide injection (consult labeling of the injection prior to initiating parenteral administration). Administration of metoclopramide injection up to 10 days maybe required before symptoms subside at which time oral administration may be instituted. Since diabetic gastric stasis is frequently recurrent, metoclopramide therapy should be reinstituted at the earliest manifestation. Use in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Since metoclopramide is excreted principally through the kidneys, in those patients whose creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min, therapy should be initiated at approximately one-half the recommended dosage. Depending upon clinical efficacy and safety considerations, the dosage may be increased or decreased as appropriate. See OVERDOSAGE section for information regarding dialysis. Metoclopramide undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, except for simple conjugation. Its safe use has been described in patients with advanced liver disease whose renal function was normal.",

    "overdose_warning": "OVERDOSAGE Symptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions. Anticholinergic or antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions. Symptoms are self-limiting and usually disappear within 24 hours. Hemodialysis removes relatively little metoclopramide, probably because of the small amount of the drug in blood relative to tissues. Similarly, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis does not remove significant amounts of drug. It is unlikely that dosage would need to be adjusted to compensate for losses through dialysis. Dialysis is not likely to be an effective method of drug removal in overdose situations. Unintentional overdose due to misadministration has been reported in infants and children with the use of metoclopramide oral solution. While there was no consistent pattern to the reports associated with these overdoses, events included seizures, extrapyramidal reactions, and lethargy. Methemoglobinemia has occurred in premature and full-term neonates who were given overdoses of metoclopramide (1 to 4 mg/kg/day orally, intramuscularly or intravenously for 1 to 3 or more days). Methemoglobinemia can be reversed by the intravenous administration of methylene blue. However, methylene blue may cause hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, which may be fatal (see PRECAUTIONS-Other Special Populations ).",

( 7.1 ) Patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. ( 7.2 ) CYP2D6 Inhibitors are likely to increase metoprolol concentration. ( 7.3 ) Concomitant use of glycosides, clonidine, and diltiazem and verapamil with beta-blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. ( 7.4 ) Beta-blockers including metoprolol, may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Catecholamine Depleting Drugs Catecholamine depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Observe patients treated with metoprolol plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.2 Epinephrine While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat an allergic reaction. 7.3 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone were shown to double metoprolol concentrations. While there is no information about moderate or weak inhibitors, these too are likely to increase metoprolol concentration. Increases in plasma concentration decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Monitor patients closely, when the combination cannot be avoided. 7.4 Negative Chronotropes Digitalis glycosides, clonidine, diltiazem and verapamil slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use with beta-blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. If clonidine and a beta-blocker, such as metoprolol are coadministered, withdraw the beta-blocker several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine because beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, delay the introduction of beta-blockers for several days after clonidine administration has stopped ."

Worsening AV block [see Contraindications (4) ]. ­Most common adverse reactions: tiredness, dizziness, depression, shortness of breath, bradycardia, hypotension, diarrhea, pruritus, rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharma Holdings, Inc. at 1-844-874-7464 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypertension and Angina Most adverse effects have been mild and transient. Central Nervous System: Tiredness and dizziness have occurred in about 10% of patients. Depression has been reported in about 5 of 100 patients. Mental confusion and short-term memory loss have been reported. Headache, nightmares, and insomnia have also been reported. Cardiovascular: Shortness of breath and bradycardia have occurred in approximately 3% of patients. Cold extremities; arterial insufficiency, usually of the Raynaud type; palpitations; heart failure exacerbations; peripheral edema; and hypotension have been reported in about 1% of patients. Gangrene in patients with pre-existing severe peripheral circulatory disorders has also been reported. [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Respiratory: Wheezing (bronchospasm) and dyspnea have been reported in about 1% of patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Rhinitis has also been reported. Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea has occurred in about 5% of patients. Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, and heartburn have been reported in about 1% of patients. Vomiting was a common occurrence. Hypersensitive Reactions: Pruritus or rash have occurred in about 5% of patients. Photosensitivity and worsening of psoriasis has been reported. Miscellaneous: Peyronie’s disease, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, and tinnitus has been reported. Myocardial Infarction In general, the adverse reactions observed in trials with metoprolol in MI are consistent with the hypertension and angina experience. In a randomized comparison of metoprolol and placebo in the setting of acute MI the following adverse reactions were reported: Metoprolol Placebo Hypotension (systolic BP < 90 mm Hg) 27.4% 23.2% Bradycardia (heart rate < 40 beats/min) 15.9% 6.7% Second- or third-degree heart block 4.7% 4.7% First-degree heart block (P-R ≥ 0.26 sec) 5.3% 1.9% Heart failure 27.5% 29.6% 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of metoprolol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System: Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia; an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation for time and place, short-term memory loss, emotional lability, slightly clouded sensorium, and decreased performance on neuropsychometrics. Cardiovascular: Intensification of AV block [see Contraindications (4) ]. Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, nonthrombocytopenic purpura and thrombocytopenic purpura.

( 2.2 ) Myocardial Infarction: The starting dosage depends upon tolerance of intravenous metoprolol, see full prescribing information. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Hypertension Individualize the dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses. Adjust dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. While once-daily dosing can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period. Larger or more frequent daily doses may be required. Measure blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the day. 2.2 Angina Pectoris The dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 2.3 Myocardial Infarction See prescribing information of intravenous metoprolol for dosage instructions for intravenous therapy. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose, initiate metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose of metoprolol and continue for 48 hours. In the case of intolerance, reduce dose to 25 mg and administer for 48 hours. Titrate, based on tolerability, to a maintenance dosage of 100 mg twice daily. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of metoprolol tartrate tablets beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta-blockers suggest that treatment should be continued for 1 to 3 years.",

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Do not prescribe montelukast sodium to treat an acute asthma attack (5.1). • Advise patients to have appropriate rescue medication available (5.1). • Inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually. Do not abruptly substitute montelukast sodium for inhaled or oral corticosteroids (5.2). • Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue to avoid aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium (5.3). • Neuropsychiatric events have been reported with montelukast sodium. Instruct patients to be alert for neuropsychiatric events. Evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur (5.4 and 6.2). • Systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, has been reported. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy (5.5 and 6.2). • Inform patients with phenylketonuria that the 4-mg and 5-mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine (5.6). 5.1 Acute Asthma Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. 5.2 Concomitant Corticosteroid Use While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. 5.3 Aspirin Sensitivity Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 5.4 Neuropsychiatric Events Neuropsychiatric events have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients taking montelukast sodium. Post-marketing reports with montelukast sodium use include agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior (including suicide), and tremor. The clinical details of some post-marketing reports involving montelukast sodium appear consistent with a drug-induced effect. Patients and prescribers should be alert for neuropsychiatric events. Patients should be instructed to notify their prescriber if these changes occur. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Eosinophilic Conditions Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between montelukast sodium and these underlying conditions has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that the 4-mg and 5-mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame), 0.168 and 0.210 mg per 4-mg and 5-mg chewable tablet, respectively."

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administration (by indications): • Asthma (2.1):Once daily in the evening for patients 2 years and older. • Acute prevention of EIB (2.2): One tablet at least 2 hours before exercise for patients 15 years of age and older. • Seasonal allergic rhinitis (2.3): Once daily for patients 2 years and older. • Perennial allergic rhinitis (2.3): Once daily for patients 2 years and older. Dosage (by age): • 15 years and older: one 10-mg tablet. • 2 to 5 years: one 4-mg chewable tablet . • 6 to 14 years: one 5-mg chewable tablet. Patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis should take only one dose daily in the evening (2.4). 2.1 Asthma Montelukast sodium should be taken once daily in the evening. The following doses are recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. For pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: one 5-mg chewable tablet. For pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age: one 4-mg chewable tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age with asthma have not been established. There have been no clinical trials in patients with asthma to evaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar whether dosed in the morning or evening. Efficacy has been demonstrated for asthma when montelukast was administered in the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. 2.2 Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB) in Patients 15 Years of Age and Older For prevention of EIB, a single 10 mg dose of montelukast should be taken at least 2 hours before exercise. An additional dose of montelukast should not be taken within 24 hours of a previous dose. Patients already taking montelukast sodium daily for another indication (including chronic asthma) should not take an additional dose to prevent EIB. All patients should have available for rescue a short-acting β‑agonist. Safety and effectiveness in patients younger than 15 years of age have not been established. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. Pediatric use information for patients ages 6 to 14 years of age for acute prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is approved for Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp's montelukast tablet products. However , due to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp's marketing exclusivity rights , this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 2.3 Allergic Rhinitis For allergic rhinitis, montelukast sodium should be taken once daily. Efficacy was demonstrated for seasonal allergic rhinitis when montelukast was administered in the morning or the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. The time of administration may be individualized to suit patient needs. The following doses for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis are recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. For pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: one 5-mg chewable tablet. For pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age: one 4-mg chewable tablet . Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis have not been established. The following doses for the treatment of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis are recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. For pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: one 5-mg chewable tablet. For pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age: one 4-mg chewable tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established. 2.4 Asthma and Allergic Rhinitis Patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis should take only one montelukast sodium dose daily in the evening.",

In chronic asthma studies, montelukast has been administered at doses up to 200 mg/day to adult patients for 22 weeks and, in short-term studies, up to 900 mg/day to patients for approximately a week without clinically important adverse experiences. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required. There have been reports of acute overdosage in post-marketing experience and clinical studies with montelukast sodium. These include reports in adults and children with a dose as high as 1000 mg. The clinical and laboratory findings observed were consistent with the safety profile in adults and pediatric patients. There were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of montelukast sodium and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. It is not known whether montelukast is removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.",

Precautions Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folic acid to patients with undiagnosed anemia, since folic acid may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. The patient’s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered.

( 5.3 ) Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea (CDAD): If diarrhea occurs, evaluate patients for CDAD. ( 5.4 ) Potential for Microbial Overgrowth: Prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms, including fungi.

( 5.6 ) 5.1 Severe Allergic Reactions Systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, and generalized rash, have been reported in patients treated with formulations of mupirocin, including mupirocin cream [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . 5.2 Eye Irritation Avoid contact with the eyes. In case of accidental contact, rinse well with water. 5.3 Local Irritation In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation from mupirocin cream, usage should be discontinued, and appropriate alternative therapy for the infection instituted. 5.4 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.5 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth As with other antibacterial products, prolonged use of mupirocin cream may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms, including fungi [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . 5.6 Risk Associated with Mucosal Use Mupirocin cream is not formulated for use on mucosal surfaces.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity : Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop.

( 5.4 , 7 ) Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid use of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.5 ) Renal Toxicity : Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid use of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. ( 5.6 ) Anaphylactic Reactions: Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.

Fetal Toxicity: Limit use of NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, between about 20 to 30 weeks in pregnancy due to the risk of oligohydramnios/fetal dysfunction. Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy due to the risks of oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 5.11 , 8.1 ) Hematologic Toxicity : Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including naproxen, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: • Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. • Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. • Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. • Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. • If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. • In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported. Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including naproxen. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and “flu-like” symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. 5.4 Hypertension NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.5 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of naproxen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Avoid the use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. Since each naproxen sodium tablet contains 50 mg of sodium (about 2 mEq per each 500 mg of naproxen), this should be considered in patients whose overall intake of sodium must be severely restricted. 5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Avoid the use of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions Naproxen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to naproxen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. When naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.9 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.10 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.11 Fetal Toxicity Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Avoid use of NSAIDs , including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age. Oligohydramnios /Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs , including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Long-Term Use and Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.6 ) ]. Patients with initial hemoglobin values of 10g or less who are to receive long-term therapy should have hemoglobin values determined periodically. Because of adverse eye findings in animal studies with drugs of this class, it is recommended that ophthalmic studies be carried out if any change or disturbance in vision occurs."

Adverse reactions reported in controlled clinical trials in 960 patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis are listed below. In general, reactions in patients treated chronically were reported 2 to 10 times more frequently than they were in short-term studies in the 962 patients treated for mild to moderate pain or for dysmenorrhea. The most frequent complaints reported related to the gastrointestinal tract. A clinical study found gastrointestinal reactions to be more frequent and more severe in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking daily doses of 1500 mg naproxen compared to those taking 750 mg naproxen. In controlled clinical trials with about 80 pediatric patients and in well-monitored, open-label studies with about 400 pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis treated with naproxen, the incidence of rash and prolonged bleeding times were greater, the incidence of gastrointestinal and central nervous system reactions were about the same, and the incidence of other reactions were lower in pediatric patients than in adults. In patients taking naproxen in clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse experiences in approximately 1% to 10% of patients were: Gastrointestinal (GI) Experiences, including: heartburn*, abdominal pain*, nausea*, constipation*, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis Central Nervous System: headache*, dizziness*, drowsiness*, lightheadedness, vertigo Dermatologic: pruritus (itching)*, skin eruptions*, ecchymoses*, sweating, purpura Special Senses: tinnitus*, visual disturbances, hearing disturbances Cardiovascular: edema*, palpitations General: dyspnea*, thirst *Incidence of reported reaction between 3% and 9%. Those reactions occurring in less than 3% of the patients are unmarked. In patients taking NSAIDs, the following adverse experiences have also been reported in approximately 1% to 10% of patients. Gastrointestinal (GI) Experiences, including: flatulence, gross bleeding/perforation, GI ulcers (gastric/duodenal), vomiting General: abnormal renal function, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, increased bleeding time, rashes The following are additional adverse experiences reported in <1% of patients taking naproxen during clinical trials. Gastrointestinal: pancreatitis, vomiting Hepatobiliary: jaundice Hemic and Lymphatic: melena, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis Nervous System: inability to concentrate Dermatologic: skin rashes 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of naproxen. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following are additional adverse experiences reported in <1% of patients taking naproxen during clinical trials and through postmarketing reports. Those adverse reactions observed through postmarketing reports are italicized. Body as a Whole: anaphylactoid reactions, angioneurotic edema, menstrual disorders, pyrexia (chills and fever) Cardiovascular: congestive heart failure, vasculitis, hypertension, pulmonary edema Gastrointestinal: inflammation, bleeding (sometimes fatal, particularly in the elderly), ulceration, perforation and obstruction of the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract. Esophagitis, stomatitis, hematemesis, colitis, exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease).

    "overdose_warning": "10 OVERDOSAGE Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 ) ].Because naproxen sodium may be rapidly absorbed, high and early blood levels should be anticipated. A few patients have experienced convulsions, but it is not clear whether or not these were drug-related. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life threatening [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.4 , 5.6 ) ]. Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastric Malignancy : In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing. ( 5.1 ) Injection Site Reactions : Thrombophlebitis is associated with the administration of intravenous pantoprazole sodium. Assess the patient and remove the catheter if clinically indicated. ( 5.2 ) Potential Exacerbation of Zinc Deficiency : Consider zinc supplementation in patients who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously. ( 5.3 ) Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis : Discontinue treatment and evaluate patients. ( 5.4 ) Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea : PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk. ( 5.5 ) Bone Fracture : Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. ( 5.6 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.7 ) Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus : Mostly cutaneous; new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue treatment and refer to specialist for evaluation. ( 5.8 ) Hepatic Effects : Elevations of transaminases observed. ( 5.9 ) Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism : Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs. ( 5.10 ) Fundic Gland Polyp s : Risk increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Use the shortest duration of therapy. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy. 5.2 Injection Site Reactions Thrombophlebitis was associated with the administration of pantoprazole sodium. Assess the patient and remove the catheter if clinically indicated. 5.3 Potential for Exacerbation of Zinc Deficiency Pantoprazole sodium for injection contains edetate disodium (the salt form of EDTA), a chelator of metal ions including zinc. Therefore, zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with pantoprazole sodium for injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . 5.4 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea, anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia). Discontinue pantoprazole sodium and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.5 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.4 ) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.7 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of PPIs [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Discontinue pantoprazole sodium at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.8 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including pantoprazole sodium. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE. The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported. Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving pantoprazole sodium, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations. 5.9 Hepatic Effects Mild, transient transaminase elevations have been observed in clinical studies. The clinical significance of this finding in a large population of subjects administered pantoprazole sodium is unknown [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 5.10 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of pantoprazole sodium and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI. 5.11 Fundic Gland Polyps PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.12 Interference with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop pantoprazole sodium treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 5.13 Interference with Urine Screen for THC Pantoprazole sodium may produce false-positive urine screen for THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.14 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole Sodium with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7) ]."

    "overdose_warning": "10 OVERDOSAGE Experience in patients taking very high doses of pantoprazole (greater than 240 mg) is limited. Adverse reactions seen in spontaneous reports of overdose generally reflect the known safety profile of pantoprazole sodium. Pantoprazole is not removed by hemodialysis. In case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Single intravenous doses of pantoprazole at 378, 230, and 266 mg/kg (38, 46, and 177 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) were lethal to mice, rats and dogs, respectively. The symptoms of acute toxicity were hypoactivity, ataxia, hunched sitting, limb-splay, lateral position, segregation, absence of ear reflex, and tremor.",

      "WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF XARELTO INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS, (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF XARELTO INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS, (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. (A) Premature discontinuation of XARELTO increases the risk of thrombotic events Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including XARELTO, increases the risk of thrombotic events. To reduce this risk, consider coverage with another anticoagulant if XARELTO is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 5.1 , 14.1 ) (B) Spinal/epidural hematoma Epidural or spinal hematomas have occurred in patients treated with XARELTO who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 6.2 ) Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment and if observed, treat urgently. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients who are or who need to be anticoagulated. ( 5.3 ) A. Premature discontinuation of XARELTO increases the risk of thrombotic events Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including XARELTO, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with XARELTO is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , and Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . B. Spinal/epidural hematoma Epidural or spinal hematomas have occurred in patients treated with XARELTO who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include: use of indwelling epidural catheters concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery optimal timing between the administration of XARELTO and neuraxial procedures is not known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers ( 7.2 , 7.3 ) Anticoagulants: Avoid concomitant use ( 7.4 ) 7.1 General Inhibition and Induction Properties Rivaroxaban is a substrate of CYP3A4/5, CYP2J2, and the P-gp and ATP-binding cassette G2 (ABCG2) transporters. Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors increase exposure to rivaroxaban and may increase the risk of bleeding. Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers decrease exposure to rivaroxaban and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 7.2 Drugs that Inhibit Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems Interaction with Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid concomitant administration of XARELTO with known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole and ritonavir) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Although clarithromycin is a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitor, pharmacokinetic data suggests that no precautions are necessary with concomitant administration with XARELTO as the change in exposure is unlikely to affect the bleeding risk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Interaction with Combined P-gp and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors in Patients with Renal Impairment XARELTO should not be used in patients with CrCl 15 to <80 mL/min who are receiving concomitant combined P-gp and moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin) unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Drugs that Induce Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems Avoid concomitant use of XARELTO with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's wort) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.4 Anticoagulants and NSAIDs/Aspirin Coadministration of enoxaparin, warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel and chronic NSAID use may increase the risk of bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Avoid concurrent use of XARELTO with other anticoagulants due to increased bleeding risk unless benefit outweighs risk. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss if patients are treated concomitantly with aspirin, other platelet aggregation inhibitors, or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis : Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs, and higher rosuvastatin dosage. Asian patients may be at higher risk for myopathy. Discontinue rosuvastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Temporarily discontinue rosuvastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing rosuvastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. ( 5.1 ) Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM) : Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported with statin use. Discontinue rosuvastatin if IMNM is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hepatic Dysfunction : Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzymes before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue rosuvastatin. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Rosuvastatin may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including rosuvastatin. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher rosuvastatin dosage. Asian patients on rosuvastatin may be at higher risk for myopathy [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 )] . The myopathy risk is greater in patients taking rosuvastatin 40 mg daily compared with lower rosuvastatin dosages. Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis The concomitant use of rosuvastatin with cyclosporine or gemfibrozil is not recommended. Rosuvastatin dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain antiviral medications, darolutamide, and regorafenib [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Discontinue rosuvastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if rosuvastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue rosuvastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy). Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the rosuvastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue rosuvastatin if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of rosuvastatin [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, increases in serum transaminases to more than three times the ULN occurred in 1.1% of patients taking rosuvastatin versus 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with rosuvastatin. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including rosuvastatin. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Consider liver enzyme testing before rosuvastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Rosuvastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue rosuvastatin. 5.4 Proteinuria and Hematuria In the rosuvastatin clinical trial program, dipstick-positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among rosuvastatin treated patients. These findings were more frequent in patients taking rosuvastatin 40 mg, when compared to lower doses of rosuvastatin or comparator statins, though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function. Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown, consider a dose reduction for patients on rosuvastatin therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and/or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing. 5.5 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including rosuvastatin. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices."

      "WARNINGS Paradoxical Bronchospasm : In the clinical study of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, paradoxical bronchospasm was not observed. However, paradoxical bronchospasm has been observed with both inhaled ipratropium bromide and albuterol products and can be life-threatening. If this occurs, Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. Do Not Exceed Recommended Dose : Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled products containing sympathomimetic amines and with the home use of nebulizers. Cardiovascular Effect: Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, like other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon for Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of the T-wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to albuterol and/or ipratropium bromide may occur after the administration of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution as demonstrated by rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, pruritus, oropharyngeal edema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Acute Pancreatitis : Has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including RYBELSUS. Discontinue promptly if pancreatitis is suspected. ( 5.2 ) • Diabetic Retinopathy Complications : Has been reported in a cardiovascular outcomes trial with semaglutide injection. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored. ( 5.3 ) • Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin : May increase the risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. Reducing the dosage of insulin secretagogue or insulin may be necessary. ( 5.4 ) • Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion : Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment reporting adverse reactions that could lead to volume depletion. ( 5.5 ) • Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions : Use of RYBELSUS has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe. RYBELSUS is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis. ( 5.6 ) • Hypersensitivity Reactions : Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis and angioedema) have been reported. Discontinue RYBELSUS if hypersensitivity reactions occur and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. ( 5.7 ) • Acute Gallbladder Disease : If cholelithiasis or cholecystitis are suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. ( 5.8 ) • Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation : Has been reported in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers of any planned surgeries or procedures. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors In mice and rats, semaglutide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . It is unknown whether RYBELSUS causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans. RYBELSUS is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of RYBELSUS and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with RYBELSUS. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low-test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin value may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated. 5.2 Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including RYBELSUS [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . After initiation of RYBELSUS, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis, which may include persistent or severe abdominal pain (sometimes radiating to the back), and which may or may not be accompanied by nausea or vomiting. If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue RYBELSUS and initiate appropriate management. 5.3 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications In a pooled analysis of glycemic control trials with RYBELSUS, patients reported diabetic retinopathy related adverse reactions during the trial (4.2% with RYBELSUS and 3.8% with comparator) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In a 2-year CV outcomes trial with semaglutide injection involving patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high CV risk, diabetic retinopathy complications (which was a 4-component adjudicated endpoint) occurred in patients treated with semaglutide injection (3%) compared to placebo (1.8%). The absolute risk increase for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy at baseline (semaglutide injection 8.2%, placebo 5.2%) than among patients without a known history of diabetic retinopathy (semaglutide injection 0.7%, placebo 0.4%). Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. The effect of long-term glycemic control with semaglutide on diabetic retinopathy complications has not been studied. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy. 5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Patients receiving RYBELSUS in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dosage of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, in some cases requiring hemodialysis, in patients treated with semaglutide. The majority of the reported events occurred in patients who experienced gastrointestinal reactions leading to dehydration such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to RYBELSUS that could lead to volume depletion, especially during dosage initiation and escalation of RYBELSUS. 5.6 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Use of RYBELSUS has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . In RYBELSUS clinical trials, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving RYBELSUS (7 mg 0.6%, 14 mg 2%) than placebo (0.3%). Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have also been reported postmarketing with GLP-1 receptor agonists. RYBELSUS is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported in patients treated with RYBELSUS. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of RYBELSUS; treat promptly per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. RYBELSUS is contraindicated in patients with a prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to semaglutide or to any of the excipients in RYBELSUS [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with another GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to anaphylaxis with RYBELSUS. 5.8 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. In placebo-controlled trials to improve glycemic control, cholelithiasis was reported in 1% of patients treated with RYBELSUS 7 mg. In a 4-year CV outcomes trial (Trial 7), cholelithiasis was reported in 1.1% of patients treated with RYBELSUS 14 mg and in 0.9% of placebo-treated patients. In Trial 7, cholecystitis was reported in 1.1% of patients treated with RYBELSUS 14 mg and in 0.7% of placebo-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . If cholelithiasis or cholecystitis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . 5.9 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation RYBELSUS delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations. Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking RYBELSUS, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing RYBELSUS could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking RYBELSUS."

    "content": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Major Depressive Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of a major depressive episode was established in six to eight week controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III category of major depressive disorder (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). A major depressive episode implies a prominent and relatively persistent depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks); it should include at least 4 of the following 8 symptoms: change in appetite, change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. The antidepressant action of sertraline hydrochloride in hospitalized depressed patients has not been adequately studied. The efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 44 weeks following 8 weeks of open-label acute treatment (52 weeks total) was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. The usefulness of the drug in patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should be reevaluated periodically (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of obsessions and compulsions in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as defined in the DSM-III-R; i.e., the obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time-consuming, or significantly interfere with social or occupational functioning. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride was established in 12-week trials with obsessive-compulsive outpatients having diagnoses of obsessive-compulsive disorder as defined according to DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images (obsessions) that are ego-dystonic and/or repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors (compulsions) that are recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response, in patients with OCD who responded during a 52-week treatment phase while taking Sertraline hydrochloride and were then observed for relapse during a period of up to 28 weeks, was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Panic Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder in adults, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-IV. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride was established in three 10-12 week trials in adult panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-III-R category of panic disorder (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response, in adult patients with panic disorder who responded during a 52-week treatment phase while taking Sertraline hydrochloride and were then observed for relapse during a period of up to 28 weeks, was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) – Sertraline hydrochloride (sertraline hydrochloride) is indicated for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder in adults. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PTSD was established in two 12-week placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnosis met criteria for the DSM-III-R category of PTSD (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). PTSD, as defined by DSM-III-R/IV, requires exposure to a traumatic event that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or threat to the physical integrity of self or others, and a response which involves intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Symptoms that occur as a result of exposure to the traumatic event include reexperiencing of the event in the form of intrusive thoughts, flashbacks or dreams, and intense psychological distress and physiological reactivity on exposure to cues to the event; avoidance of situations reminiscent of the traumatic event, inability to recall details of the event, and/or numbing of general responsiveness manifested as diminished interest in significant activities, estrangement from others, restricted range of affect, or sense of foreshortened future; and symptoms of autonomic arousal including hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, and irritability or outbursts of anger. A PTSD diagnosis requires that the symptoms are present for at least a month and that they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response in adult patients with PTSD for up to 28 weeks following 24 weeks of open-label treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in adults. The efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PMDD was established in 2 placebo-controlled trials of female adult outpatients treated for 3 menstrual cycles who met criteria for the DSM-IIIR/IV category of PMDD (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). The essential features of PMDD include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. These symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school or with usual social activities and relationships with others. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders that may be exacerbated by treatment with an antidepressant. The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 menstrual cycles, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Social Anxiety Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia in adults. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of social anxiety disorder was established in two placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Social anxiety disorder, as defined by DSM-IV, is characterized by marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations involving exposure to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others and by fears of acting in a humiliating or embarrassing way. Exposure to the feared social situation almost always provokes anxiety and feared social or performance situations are avoided or else are endured with intense anxiety or distress. In addition, patients recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable and the avoidance and anticipatory anxiety of the feared situation is associated with functional impairment or marked distress. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response in adult patients with social anxiety disorder for up to 24 weeks following 20 weeks of Sertraline hydrochloride treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. Physicians who prescribe Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ).",

      "BOXED WARNING Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of Sertraline hydrochloride or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Sertraline hydrochloride tablets are not approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder in pediatric patients. (See WARNINGS:Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk , PRECAUTIONS:Information for Patients , and PRECAUTIONS:Pediatric Use )."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS All Dosage Forms of Sertraline: The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with Sertraline hydrochloride or within 14 days of stopping treatment with Sertraline hydrochloride is contraindicated because of an because of an increased risk if serotonin syndrome. The use of Sertraline hydrochloride within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders is also contraindicated (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Starting Sertraline hydrochloride in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methyelene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Concomitant use in patients taking pimozide is contraindicated (see PRECAUTIONS ). Sertraline is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to sertraline or any of the inactive ingredients in sertraline hydrochloride tablets."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Potential Effects of Coadministration of Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Proteins –Because sertraline is tightly bound to plasma protein, the administration of sertraline hydrochloride to a patient taking another drug which is tightly bound to protein (e.g., warfarin, digitoxin) may cause a shift in plasma concentrations potentially resulting in an adverse effect. Conversely, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein bound sertraline hydrochloride by other tightly bound drugs. In a study comparing prothrombin time AUC (0-120 hr) following dosing with warfarin (0.75 mg/kg) before and after 21 days of dosing with either sertraline hydrochloride (50-200 mg/day) or placebo, there was a mean increase in prothrombin time of 8% relative to baseline for sertraline hydrochloride compared to a 1% decrease for placebo (p<0.02). The normalization of prothrombin time for the sertraline hydrochloride group was delayed compared to the placebo group. The clinical significance of this change is unknown. Accordingly, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored when sertraline hydrochloride therapy is initiated or stopped. Cimetidine –In a study assessing disposition of sertraline hydrochloride (100 mg) on the second of 8 days of cimetidine administration (800 mg daily), there were significant increases in sertraline hydrochloride mean AUC (50%), C max (24%) and half-life (26%) compared to the placebo group. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown. CNS Active Drugs –In a study comparing the disposition of intravenously administered diazepam before and after 21 days of dosing with either sertraline hydrochloride (50 to 200 mg/day escalating dose) or placebo, there was a 32% decrease relative to baseline in diazepam clearance for the sertraline hydrochloride group compared to a 19% decrease relative to baseline for the placebo group (p<0.03). There was a 23% increase in T max for desmethyldiazepam in the sertraline hydrochloride group compared to a 20% decrease in the placebo group (p<0.03). The clinical significance of these changes is unknown. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of two doses of Sertraline hydrochloride did not significantly alter steady-state lithium levels or the renal clearance of lithium. Nonetheless, at this time, it is recommended that plasma lithium levels be monitored following initiation of Sertraline hydrochloride therapy with appropriate adjustments to the lithium dose. In a controlled study of a single dose (2 mg) of pimozide, 200 mg sertraline (q.d.) co-administration to steady state was associated with a mean increase in pimozide AUC and C max of about 40%, but was not associated with any changes in EKG. Since the highest recommended pimozide dose (10 mg) has not been evaluated in combination with sertraline, the effect on QT interval and PK parameters at doses higher than 2 mg at this time are not known. While the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, due to the narrow therapeutic index of pimozide and due to the interaction noted at a low dose of pimozide, concomitant administration of Sertraline hydrochloride and pimozide should be contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Results of a placebo-controlled trail in normal volunteers suggest that chronic administration of sertraline 200 mg/day does not produce clinically important inhibition of phenytoin metabolism. Nonetheless, at this time, it is recommended that plasma phenytoin concentrations be monitored following initiation of Sertraline Hydrochloride therapy with appropriate adjustments to the phenytoin dose, particularly in patients with multiple underlying medical conditions and/or those receiving multiple concomitant medications. The effect of Sertraline hydrochloride on valproate levels has not been evaluated in clinical trials. In the absence of such data, it is recommended that plasma valproate levels be monitored following initiation of Sertraline hydrochloride therapy with appropriate adjustments to the valproate dose. The risk of using sertraline hydrochloride in combination with other CNS active drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of sertraline hydrochloride and such drugs is required. There is limited controlled experience regarding the optimal timing of switching from other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder to sertraline hydrochloride. Care and prudent medical judgment should be exercised when switching, particularly from long-acting agents. The duration of an appropriate washout period which should intervene before switching from one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to another has not been established. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors –See CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Drugs Metabolized by P450 3A4 –In three separate in vivo interaction studies, sertraline was co-administered with cytochrome P450 3A4 substrates, terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride under steady-state conditions. The results of these studies indicated that sertraline did not increase plasma concentrations of terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride. These data indicate that sertraline's extent of inhibition of P450 3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance. Results of the interaction study with cisapride indicate that sertraline 200 mg (q.d.) induces the metabolism of cisapride (cisapride AUC and C max were reduced by about 35%). Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 – Many drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, e.g., the SSRIs, including sertraline, and most tricyclic antidepressant drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder inhibit the biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase), and, thus, may increase the plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs that are metabolized by P450 2D6. The drugs for which this potential interaction is of greatest concern are those metabolized primarily by 2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic index, e.g., the tricyclic antidepressant drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide. The extent to which this interaction is an important clinical problem depends on the extent of the inhibition of P450 2D6 by the antidepressant and the therapeutic index of the coadministered drug. There is variability among the drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder in the extent of clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and in fact sertraline at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class. Nevertheless, even sertraline has the potential for clinically important 2D6 inhibition. Consequently, concomitant use of a drug metabolized by P450 2D6 with sertraline hydrochloride may require lower doses than usually prescribed for the other drug. Furthermore, whenever sertraline hydrochloride is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of the co-administered drug may be required (see Tricyclic Antidepressant Drugs Effective in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder under PRECAUTIONS). Serotonergic Drugs: see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Triptans: There have been rare post marketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SNRI or an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant treatment of SNRIs and SSRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride, with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS – Serotonin Syndrome). Sumatriptan –There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and sumatriptan. If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI (e.g., citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised. Tricyclic Antidepressant Drugs Effective in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (TCAs) –The extent to which SSRI–TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with sertraline hydrochloride, because sertraline may inhibit TCA metabolism. Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored, and the dose of TCA may need to be reduced, if a TCA is co-administered with sertraline hydrochloride (see Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 under PRECAUTIONS ). Hypoglycemic Drugs –In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, administration of sertraline hydrochloride for 22 days (including 200 mg/day for the final 13 days) caused a statistically significant 16% decrease from baseline in the clearance of tolbutamide following an intravenous 1000 mg dose. Sertraline hydrochloride administration did not noticeably change either the plasma protein binding or the apparent volume of distribution of tolbutamide, suggesting that the decreased clearance was due to a change in the metabolism of the drug. The clinical significance of this decrease in tolbutamide clearance is unknown. Atenolol – Sertraline hydrochloride (100 mg) when administered to 10 healthy male subjects had no effect on the beta-adrenergic blocking ability of atenolol. Digoxin –In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, administration of sertraline hydrochloride for 17 days (including 200 mg/day for the last 10 days) did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal clearance. Microsomal Enzyme Induction –Preclinical studies have shown sertraline hydrochloride to induce hepatic microsomal enzymes. In clinical studies, sertraline hydrochloride was shown to induce hepatic enzymes minimally as determined by a small (5%) but statistically significant decrease in antipyrine half-life following administration of 200 mg/day for 21 days. This small change in antipyrine half-life reflects a clinically insignificant change in hepatic metabolism. Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (Non-selective NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin, etc.) Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. These studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs or SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when Sertraline hydrochloride is initiated or discontinued. Electroconvulsive Therapy –There are no clinical studies establishing the risks or benefits of the combined use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and Sertraline hydrochloride. Alcohol –Although Sertraline hydrochloride did not potentiate the cognitive and psychomotor effects of alcohol in experiments with normal subjects, the concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride and alcohol is not recommended. Carcinogenesis –Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were carried out in CD-1 mice and Long-Evans rats at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day. These doses correspond to 1 times (mice) and 2 times (rats) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2 basis. There was a dose-related increase of liver adenomas in male mice receiving sertraline at 10-40 mg/kg (0.25-1.0 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). No increase was seen in female mice or in rats of either sex receiving the same treatments, nor was there an increase in hepatocellular carcinomas. Liver adenomas have a variable rate of spontaneous occurrence in the CD-1 mouse and are of unknown significance to humans. There was an increase in follicular adenomas of the thyroid in female rats receiving sertraline at 40 mg/kg (2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis); this was not accompanied by thyroid hyperplasia. While there was an increase in uterine adenocarcinomas in rats receiving sertraline at 10-40 mg/kg (0.5-2.0 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) compared to placebo controls, this effect was not clearly drug related. Mutagenesis –Sertraline had no genotoxic effects, with or without metabolic activation, based on the following assays: bacterial mutation assay; mouse lymphoma mutation assay; and tests for cytogenetic aberrations in vivo in mouse bone marrow and in vitro in human lymphocytes. Impairment of Fertility –A decrease in fertility was seen in one of two rat studies at a dose of 80 mg/kg (4 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis). Pregnancy–Pregnancy Category C –Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses correspond to approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence of teratogenicity at any dose level. When pregnant rats and rabbits were given sertraline during the period of organogenesis, delayed ossification was observed in fetuses at doses of 10 mg/kg (0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) in rats and 40 mg/kg (4 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) in rabbits. When female rats received sertraline during the last third of gestation and throughout lactation, there was an increase in the number of stillborn pups and in the number of pups dying during the first 4 days after birth. Pup body weights were also decreased during the first four days after birth. These effects occurred at a dose of 20 mg/kg (1 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). The no effect dose for rat pup mortality was 10 mg/kg (0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). The decrease in pup survival was shown to be due to in utero exposure to sertraline. The clinical significance of these effects is unknown. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Sertraline hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Pregnancy-Nonteratogenic Effects –Neonates exposed to sertraline hydrochloride and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. These findings are based on postmarketing reports. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS :Serotonin Syndrome). Infants exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 – 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Several recent epidemiologic studies suggest a positive statistical association between SSRI use (including sertraline hydrochloride) in pregnancy and PPHN. Other studies do not show a significant statistical association. Physicians should also note the results of a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depression, who were either on antidepressants or had received antidepressants less than 12 weeks prior to their last menstrual period, and were in remission. Women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy showed a significant increase in relapse of their major depression compared to those women who remained on antidepressant medication throughout pregnancy. When treating a pregnant woman with sertraline hydrochloride, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking an SSRI, along with the established benefits of treating depression with an antidepressant. This decision can only be made on a case by case basis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Labor and Delivery –The effect of sertraline hydrochloride on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Nursing Mothers –It is not known whether, and if so in what amount, sertraline or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when sertraline hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use – The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder was demonstrated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study with 187 outpatients ages 6-17 (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population other than pediatric patients with OCD have not been established (see BOX WARNING and WARNINGS -Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk). Two placebo controlled trials (n=373) in pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with sertraline hydrochloride, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in pediatric patients. Anyone considering the use of Sertraline hydrochloride in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need. The safety of Sertraline hydrochloride use in children and adolescents with OCD, ages 6-18, was evaluated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study with 187 outpatients, ages 6-17, and in a flexible dose, 52 week open extension study of 137 patients, ages 6-18, who had completed the initial 12week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Sertraline hydrochloride was administered at doses of either 25 mg/day (children, ages 6-12) or 50 mg/day (adolescents, ages 13-18) and then titrated in weekly 25 mg/day or 50 mg/day increments, respectively, to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day based upon clinical response. The mean dose for completers was 157 mg/day. In the acute 12 week pediatric study and in the 52 week study, Sertraline hydrochloride had an adverse event profile generally similar to that observed in adults. Sertraline pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients between 6 and 17 years of age with major depressive disorder or OCD and revealed similar drug exposures to those of adults when plasma concentration was adjusted for weight (see Pharmacokinetics under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Approximately 600 patients with major depressive disorder or OCD between 6 and 17 years of age have received Sertraline hydrochloride in clinical trials, both controlled and uncontrolled. The adverse event profile observed in these patients was generally similar to that observed in adult studies with sertraline hydrochloride (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). As with other SSRIs, decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of Sertraline hydrochloride. In a pooled analysis of two 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose (50-200 mg) outpatient trials for major depressive disorder (n=373), there was a difference in weight change between sertraline and placebo of roughly 1 kilogram, for both children (ages 6-11) and adolescents (ages 12-17), in both cases representing a slight weight loss for sertraline compared to a slight gain for placebo. At baseline the mean weight for children was 39.0 kg for sertraline and 38.5 kg for placebo. At baseline the mean weight for adolescents was 61.4 kg for sertraline and 62.5 kg for placebo. There was a bigger difference between sertraline and placebo in the proportion of outliers for clinically important weight loss in children than in adolescents. For children, about 7% had a weight loss > 7% of body weight compared to none of the placebo patients; for adolescents, about 2% had a weight loss > 7% of body weight compared to about 1% of the placebo patients. A subset of these patients who completed the randomized controlled trials (sertraline n=99, placebo n=122) were continued into a 24-week, flexible-dose, open-label, extension study. A mean weight loss of approximately 0.5 kg was seen during the first eight weeks of treatment for subjects with first exposure to sertraline during the open-label extension study, similar to mean weight loss observed among sertraline treated subjects during the first eight weeks of the randomized controlled trials. The subjects continuing in the open label study began gaining weight compared to baseline by week 12 of sertraline treatment. Those subjects who completed 34 weeks of sertraline treatment (10 weeks in a placebo controlled trial + 24 weeks open label, n=68) had weight gain that was similar to that expected using data from age-adjusted peers. Regular monitoring of weight and growth is recommended if treatment of a pediatric patient with an SSRI is to be continued long term. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 have not been established. The risks, if any, that may be associated with Sertraline hydrochloride's use beyond 1 year in children and adolescents with OCD or major depressive disorder have not been systematically assessed. The prescriber should be mindful that the evidence relied upon to conclude that sertraline is safe for use in children and adolescents derives from clinical studies that were 10 to 52 weeks in duration and from the extrapolation of experience gained with adult patients. In particular, there are no studies that directly evaluate the effects of long-term sertraline use on the growth, development, and maturation of children and adolescents. Although there is no affirmative finding to suggest that sertraline possesses a capacity to adversely affect growth, development or maturation, the absence of such findings is not compelling evidence of the absence of the potential of sertraline to have adverse effects in chronic use (see WARNINGS – Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk). Geriatric Use –U.S. geriatric clinical studies of Sertraline hydrochloride in major depressive disorder included 663 Sertraline hydrochloride -treated subjects ≥ 65 years of age, of those, 180 were ≥ 75 years of age. No overall differences in the pattern of adverse reactions were observed in the geriatric clinical trial subjects relative to those reported in younger subjects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ), and other reported experience has not identified differences in safety patterns between the elderly and younger subjects. As with all medications, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. There were 947 subjects in placebo-controlled geriatric clinical studies of Sertraline hydrochloride in major depressive disorder. No overall differences in the pattern of efficacy were observed in the geriatric clinical trial subjects relative to those reported in younger subjects. Other Adverse Events in Geriatric Patients. In 354 geriatric subjects treated with Sertraline hydrochloride in placebo-controlled trials, the overall profile of adverse events was generally similar to that shown in Tables 2 and 3. Urinary tract infection was the only adverse event not appearing in Tables 2 and 3 and reported at an incidence of at least 2% and at a rate greater than placebo in placebo-controlled trials. SSRIS and SNRIs, including Sertraline hydrochloride, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event (see PRECAUTIONS , Hyponatremia)."

    "overdose_warning": "OVERDOSAGE Human Experience – Of 1,027 cases of overdose involving sertraline hydrochloride worldwide, alone or with other drugs, there were 72 deaths (circa 1999). Among 634 overdoses in which sertraline hydrochloride was the only drug ingested, 8 resulted in fatal outcome, 75 completely recovered, and 27 patients experienced sequelae after overdosage to include alopecia, decreased libido, diarrhea, ejaculation disorder, fatigue, insomnia, somnolence and serotonin syndrome. The remaining 524 cases had an unknown outcome. The most common signs and symptoms associated with non-fatal sertraline hydrochloride overdosage were somnolence, vomiting, tachycardia, nausea, dizziness, agitation and tremor. The largest known ingestion was 13.5 grams in a patient who took sertraline hydrochloride alone and subsequently recovered. However, another patient who took 2.5 grams of sertraline hydrochloride alone experienced a fatal outcome. Other important adverse events reported with sertraline hydrochloride overdose (single or multiple drugs) include bradycardia, bundle branch block, coma, convulsions, delirium, hallucinations, hypertension, hypotension, manic reaction, pancreatitis, QT-interval prolongation, serotonin syndrome, stupor and syncope. Overdose Management –Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any antidepressant. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for sertraline are known. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center on the treatment of any overdose. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference ® (PDR®).",

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high-risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information. ( 5.1 ) If lactic acidosis is suspected, discontinue ZITUVIMET and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended. ( 5.1 ) Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic Acidosis: See boxed warning . ( 5.1 ) Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue ZITUVIMET. ( 5.2 ) Heart Failure : Has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of ZITUVIMET in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.3 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiating ZITUVIMET and at least annually thereafter, assess renal function. ( 5.4 ) Vitamin B 12 Deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters annually and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. ( 5.5 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.6 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop ZITUVIMET, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.7 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.8 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue ZITUVIMET. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of ZITUVIMET. In ZITUVIMET treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue ZITUVIMET and report these symptoms to their health care provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]: Before initiating ZITUVIMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). ZITUVIMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. ZITUVIMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed combination ZITUVIMET product. Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking ZITUVIMET. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of ZITUVIMET with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Radiological Studies with Contrast Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop ZITUVIMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart ZITUVIMET if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. ZITUVIMET should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue ZITUVIMET. Excessive Alcohol Intake Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving ZITUVIMET. Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of ZITUVIMET in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking ZITUVIMET. After initiation of ZITUVIMET, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, sitagliptin should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using ZITUVIMET. 5.3 Heart Failure An association between DPP-4 inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of ZITUVIMET prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of ZITUVIMET. 5.4 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiation of therapy with ZITUVIMET and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed. In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated, particularly in elderly patients, renal function should be assessed more frequently and ZITUVIMET discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present. ZITUVIMET is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 5.5 Vitamin B12 Deficiency In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 measurements at 2- to 3-year intervals in patients on ZITUVIMET and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.6 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues ZITUVIMET may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with ZITUVIMET [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin, one of the components of ZITUVIMET. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with sitagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue ZITUVIMET, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with ZITUVIMET. 5.8 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.9 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP- 4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving ZITUVIMET. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, ZITUVIMET should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

Employ the usual supportive measures dictated by the patient's clinical status. Per clinical judgement, consider removal of unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, and clinical monitoring (including obtaining an ECG). Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis. Overdose of metformin has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected.",

( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with strong cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 α 2 -Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine with other α 2 -adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomitant use of tizanidine tablets with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] .

( 2.2 , 2.6 , 12.3 ) Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration.If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) To discontinue tizanidine tablets, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Tizanidine may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment I n patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, the individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment I n patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine Tablets When discontinuing tizanidine tablets, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]. 2.6 Switching Between With/Without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage Forms There are pharmacokinetic differences when: 1) switching between administration of tizanidine tablets with or without food 2) switching between dosage forms if being administered with food.

    "overdose_warning": "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs, including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases, a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion, and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and monitor cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description ( 11 )] . In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue necrosis: Necrosis or gangrene of skin or other tissues can occur, with severe cases requiring debridement or amputation. Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative anticoagulants if necessary. ( 5.2 ) Calciphylaxis: Fatal and serious cases have occurred. Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative anticoagulation therapy. ( 5.3 ) Acute kidney injury may occur during episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria. ( 5.4 ) Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli: Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. Discontinue warfarin sodium if such emboli occur. ( 5.5 ) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): Initial therapy with warfarin sodium in HIT has resulted in cases of amputation and death. Warfarin sodium may be considered after platelet count has normalized. ( 5.6 ) Pregnant women with mechanical heart valves: Warfarin sodium may cause fetal harm; however, the benefits may outweigh the risks. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hemorrhage Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )] , certain concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] , and long duration of warfarin therapy. Perform regular monitoring of INR in all treated patients. Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding. Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Instruct patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.2 Tissue Necrosis Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other tissues, which is an uncommon but serious risk (<0.1%). Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin sodium therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported. Careful clinical evaluation is required to determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary. 5.3 Calciphylaxis Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium uremic arteriolopathy, which has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat calciphylaxis as appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy. 5.4 Acute Kidney Injury In patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a history of kidney disease, acute kidney injury may occur with warfarin sodium, possibly in relation to episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . More frequent monitoring of anticoagulation is advised in patients with compromised renal function. 5.5 Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque emboli. Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as “purple toes syndrome.” Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if such phenomena are observed. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary. 5.6 Limb Ischemia, Necrosis, and Gangrene in Patients with HIT and HITTS Do not use warfarin sodium as initial therapy in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome (HITTS). Cases of limb ischemia, necrosis, and gangrene have occurred in patients with HIT and HITTS when heparin treatment was discontinued and warfarin therapy was started or continued. In some patients, sequelae have included amputation of the involved area and/or death. Treatment with warfarin sodium may be considered after the platelet count has normalized. 5.7 Use in Pregnant Women with Mechanical Heart Valves Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. While warfarin sodium is contraindicated during pregnancy, the potential benefits of using warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism. In those individual situations, the decision to initiate or continue warfarin sodium should be reviewed with the patient, taking into consideration the specific risks and benefits pertaining to the individual patient’s medical situation, as well as the most current medical guidelines. Warfarin sodium exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.8 Other Clinical Settings with Increased Risks In the following clinical settings, the risks of warfarin sodium therapy may be increased: Moderate to severe hepatic impairment Infectious diseases or disturbances of intestinal flora (e.g., sprue, antibiotic therapy) Use of an indwelling catheter Severe to moderate hypertension Deficiency in protein C-mediated anticoagulant response: Warfarin sodium reduces the synthesis of the naturally occurring anticoagulants, protein C and protein S. Hereditary or acquired deficiencies of protein C or its cofactor, protein S, have been associated with tissue necrosis following warfarin administration. Concomitant anticoagulation therapy with heparin for 5 to 7 days during initiation of therapy with warfarin sodium may minimize the incidence of tissue necrosis in these patients. Eye surgery: In cataract surgery, warfarin sodium use was associated with a significant increase in minor complications of sharp needle and local anesthesia block but not associated with potentially sight-threatening operative hemorrhagic complications. As warfarin sodium cessation or reduction may lead to serious thromboembolic complications, the decision to discontinue warfarin sodium before a relatively less invasive and complex eye surgery, such as lens surgery, should be based upon the risks of anticoagulant therapy weighed against the benefits. Polycythemia vera Vasculitis Diabetes mellitus 5.9 Endogenous Factors Affecting INR The following factors may be responsible for increased INR response: diarrhea, hepatic disorders, poor nutritional state, steatorrhea, or vitamin K deficiency. The following factors may be responsible for decreased INR response: increased vitamin K intake or hereditary warfarin resistance."

    "overdose_warning": "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms Bleeding (e.g., appearance of blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena, petechiae, excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries, unexplained fall in hemoglobin) is a manifestation of excessive anticoagulation. 10.2 Treatment The treatment of excessive anticoagulation is based on the level of the INR, the presence or absence of bleeding, and clinical circumstances. Reversal of warfarin sodium anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing warfarin sodium therapy and, if necessary, by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K 1 . The use of vitamin K 1 reduces response to subsequent warfarin sodium therapy and patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid reversal of a prolonged INR. Resumption of warfarin sodium administration reverses the effect of vitamin K, and a therapeutic INR can again be obtained by careful dosage adjustment. If rapid re-anticoagulation is indicated, heparin may be preferable for initial therapy. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma, or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of warfarin sodium is urgent. A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to warfarin sodium overdosage.",
